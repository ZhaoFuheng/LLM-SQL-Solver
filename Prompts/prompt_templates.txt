Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2.
Your task is to quietly think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are semantic equivalent based on the DATABASE SCHEMA.
Return EQUIVALENT or NOT EQUIVALENT in Answer. If the two queries are not equivalent, then please provide a counter example.

Note: Two SQL queries are semantic equivalent if and only if they return the same output for all possible table contents.

Q1:{Q1}

Q2:{Q2}

The DATABASE SCHEMA: {schema}

MiniatureAndMull = """Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.
Your task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are semantically equivalent or not semantically equivalent.

Q1:```{Q1}```

Q2:```{Q2}```

Note: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.

1. Try one example database and observe the output of Q1 and Q2.

2. If the outputs are identical, can you modify the example database such that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical?

3. If a counter example exists, return THE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT after step 2.
   Otherwise, return THE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT after step 2.

DATABASE SCHEMA: {schema}

Your task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.

Q1:```{Q1}```

Q2:```{Q2}```

First, explain SQL query Q1 and then explain SQL query Q2. 

Are there SIGNIFICANT logic differences between Q1 and Q2?

If the differences are logically SIGNIFICANT, then the Q1 and Q2 are not equivalent.
Otherwise, Q1 and Q2 are equivalent.

Output either THE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT or THE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT at the end. (NEVER BOTH)

The DATABASE SCHEMA: {schema}

If there is at least one NULL value in the list produced by the subquery, the entire NOT IN condition will evaluate to unknown, and no rows will be returned at all.\n\nTo demonstrate this, let's consider an example database where there is a student with a NULL StuID in the Has_Pet table:\n\nStudent Table:\n| StuID | LName | Fname | Age | Sex | Major | Advisor | city_code |\n|-------|-------|-------|-----|-----|-------|---------|-----------|\n| 1     | Doe   | John  | 20  | M   | CS    | Smith   | 001       |\n| 2     | Smith | Jane  | 21  | F   | Math  | Johnson | 002       |\n\nPets Table:\n| PetID | PetType | pet_age | weight |\n|-------|---------|---------|--------|\n| 1     | cat     | 3       | 10     |\n| 2     | dog     | 5       | 20     |\n\nHas_Pet Table:\n| StuID | PetID |\n|-------|-------|\n| 1     | 1     |\n| NULL  | 2     |\n\nFor Q1, the result will be:\n| stuid |\n|-------|\n| 2     |\n\nFor Q2, because there is a NULL value in the subquery, the NOT IN condition will not return any rows, so the result will be an empty set.\n\nSince the outputs of Q1 and Q2 can be different when there are NULL values in the subquery, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT stuid FROM student EXCEPT SELECT T1.stuid FROM student AS T1 JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1.stuid  =  T2.stuid JOIN pets AS T3 ON T3.petid  =  T2.petid WHERE T3.pettype  =  'cat'```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Student.StuID  FROM Student  WHERE Student.StuID NOT IN      (SELECT Has_Pet.StuID       FROM Has_Pet       JOIN Pets ON Has_Pet.PetID = Pets.PetID       WHERE Pets.PetType = 'cat')```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

They both use subqueries to exclude students who have cats.\n\nLet's break down the WHERE clause of both queries:\n\nQ1's WHERE clause:\n- `T3.pettype = 'dog'` ensures that the pet type is a dog.\n- `T1.stuid NOT IN (...)` excludes students who have cats. The subquery inside NOT IN is joining the student, has_pet, and pets tables to find students who have cats.\n\nQ2's WHERE clause:\n- `Pets.PetType = 'dog'` ensures that the pet type is a dog.\n- `Student.StuID NOT IN (...)` excludes students who have cats. The subquery inside NOT IN is slightly different from Q1's. It first selects `StuID` from `Has_Pet` where `PetID` is in another subquery that selects `PetID` from `Pets` where `PetType = 'cat'`.\n\nThe key difference between the two queries is in the subqueries used to exclude students who have cats. In Q1, the subquery is joining all three tables to find students with cats, while in Q2, the subquery is using a nested approach to first find `PetID`s of cats and then find `StuID`s that have those `PetID`s.\n\nNow, let's consider if there's a situation where these two queries could produce different results. The potential difference could arise if a student has multiple pets, including both a dog and a cat. In such a case, Q1 would exclude this student because the join in the subquery would find the student based on having a cat, regardless of other pets. However, Q2 would also exclude this student because the nested subquery would find the `PetID` of the cat and then find the `StuID` of the student who has that cat.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that both queries are designed to produce the same result set: students who have dogs but do not have cats. Therefore, without a specific counterexample, it appears that the queries are equivalent.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely certain, we would need to test these queries against an example database.

If we can find a database where the outputs are different, then they are not equivalent.\n\nAfter careful consideration, it seems that there is no obvious counterexample that would lead to different results between Q1 and Q2.

Specifically, the join condition in Q1 is `T2.model = T3.model`, while in Q2, it is `model_list.ModelId = car_names.Model`. This suggests that Q1 is joining on a column named `model` in both `MODEL_LIST` and `CAR_NAMES`, whereas Q2 is joining on a `ModelId` column in `MODEL_LIST` and a `Model` column in `CAR_NAMES`.\n\nTo demonstrate that the queries are not equivalent, consider the following example database:\n\n```\ncar_makers\nId | Maker\n---|------\n1  | Ford\n2  | Toyota\n\nmodel_list\nModelId | Maker | Model\n--------|-------|------\n1       | 1     | Mustang\n2       | 2     | Corolla\n\ncar_names\nMakeId | Model    | Make\n-------|----------|-----\n1      | Mustang  | Ford\n2      | Corolla  | Toyota\n3      | Mustang  | Ford\n\ncars_data\nId | Year\n---|-----\n1  | 1970\n2  | 1970\n3  | 1980\n```\n\nIn this example, `car_names` has an extra row with `MakeId` 3, which does not correspond to any `Id` in `cars_data`. This row has a `Model` value of 'Mustang', which matches the `Model` value in `model_list`.\n\nWhen we run Q1, it will include the 'Ford' maker because of the join on `T2.model = T3.model`, which will match the 'Mustang' model in both `model_list` and `car_names`, even though there is no corresponding `Id` in `cars_data` for `MakeId` 3.\n\nHowever, when we run Q2, it will not include the 'Ford' maker for the extra 'Mustang' entry because `car_names.MakeId` 3 does not have a corresponding `Id` in `cars_data`. Therefore, the join condition `car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id` will not be satisfied for the extra 'Mustang' entry, and it will not be included in the results.\n\nThus, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 will not be identical for this example database, proving that the queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT DISTINCT T1.Maker FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN MODEL_LIST AS T2 ON T1.Id  =  T2.Maker JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T3 ON T2.model  =  T3.model JOIN CARS_DATA AS T4 ON T3.MakeId  =  T4.id WHERE T4.year  =  '1970';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT car_makers.Maker  FROM car_makers  INNER JOIN model_list ON car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker  INNER JOIN car_names ON model_list.ModelId = car_names.Model  INNER JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id  WHERE cars_data.Year = 1970```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The key point to notice is that Q1 groups by `t2.id` (which is `car_makers.Id`), while Q2 groups by `car_makers.Id`. Although this might seem the same at first glance, the difference lies in the fact that Q1 selects `t2.fullname` without including it in the `GROUP BY` clause, which is not standard SQL and would result in an error in most SQL databases. However, if the SQL database allows this (due to non-standard extensions or settings that allow for non-standard group by behavior), the output could potentially include a random `fullname` for each `id` group, which is not guaranteed to be the same across different executions or different databases.\n\nOn the other hand, Q2 correctly groups by `car_makers.Id` and selects `car_makers.FullName`, which is functionally dependent on `car_makers.Id` since `Id` is the primary key of the `car_makers` table.\n\nTo create a counterexample, we can assume a database that allows the non-standard behavior for Q1 and has at least one car maker with multiple full names (which violates the assumption of `Id` being a primary key, but serves to illustrate the point). Here's an example:\n\n```sql\n-- Example database setup\nCREATE TABLE car_makers (\n  Id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  Maker VARCHAR(255),\n  FullName VARCHAR(255),\n  Country INT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE model_list (\n  ModelId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  Maker INT,\n  Model VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\n-- Insert example data\nINSERT INTO car_makers (Id, Maker, FullName, Country) VALUES (1, 'Maker1', 'Car Maker A', 1);\nINSERT INTO car_makers (Id, Maker, FullName, Country) VALUES (1, 'Maker1', 'Car Maker B', 1); -- Duplicate Id with different FullName\nINSERT INTO model_list (ModelId, Maker, Model) VALUES (1, 1, 'Model1');\nINSERT INTO model_list (ModelId, Maker, Model) VALUES (2, 1, 'Model2');\n\n-- Now, let's run Q1 and Q2\n-- Q1 might return either 'Car Maker A' or 'Car Maker B' as the FullName, depending on the non-standard behavior\n-- Q2 will return a consistent result, either 'Car Maker A' or 'Car Maker B', but not both\n```\n\nIn this example, Q1 could return a different `FullName` for the same `Id` due to the non-standard grouping, while Q2 would consistently return the same `FullName` for each `Id`.

Additionally, the JOIN conditions are different, which could lead to different rows being joined, especially since Q1 uses `T1.MakeId = T2.Id` while Q2 uses a combination of joins involving `car_makers`, `model_list`, and `car_names`.\n\nHere's a counterexample:\n\nLet's say we have the following data:\n\ncar_makers:\n| Id | Maker | FullName | Country |\n|----|-------|----------|---------|\n| 1  | Ford  | Ford Inc | USA     |\n| 2  | Chevy | Chevy Co | USA     |\n\ncar_names:\n| MakeId | Model | Make |\n|--------|-------|------|\n| 1      | F150  | Ford |\n| 2      | Camaro| Chevy|\n\ncars_data:\n| Id | MPG | Cylinders | Edispl | Horsepower | Weight | Accelerate | Year |\n|----|-----|-----------|--------|------------|--------|-------------|------|\n| 1  | 20  | 3         | 1.0    | 100        | 2000   | 10          | 2020 |\n| 2  | 25  | 3         | 1.1    | 110        | 2100   | 11          | 2021 |\n\nmodel_list:\n| ModelId | Maker | Model |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 1     | F150  |\n| 2       | 2     | Camaro|\n\nIn this case, Q1 would return the car with the highest horsepower that has 3 cylinders, which is the Chevy Camaro with 110 horsepower.

In Q1, the join condition is `T1.Id = T2.Maker`, while in Q2, the join condition is `car_makers.Id = model_list.Maker`. If the `Maker` column in the `car_makers` table is not the same as the `Id` column, the results of the two queries will differ.\n\nIn our example database, the `Maker` column in the `car_makers` table is the same as the `Id` column, so the join condition in both queries effectively does the same thing.

There is a car maker with the full name 'General Motors' and an ID of 1 in the `car_makers` table.\n2. There is a model called 'ModelX' made by 'General Motors' (Maker ID 1) in the `model_list` table.\n3. There is a car with a `MakeId` of 2 and a `Model` of 'ModelX' in the `car_names` table.\n4. There is a car data entry with an `Id` of 2 and a `Weight` of 3600 in the `cars_data` table.\n\nNow, let's analyze the queries:\n\nQ1 joins four tables and filters the results where the `FullName` of the maker is 'General Motors' or the `Weight` is greater than 3500. This query will return 'ModelX' because it joins on the `Model` and checks for the `FullName` in `car_makers` or the `Weight` in `cars_data`.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, selects distinct models from the `model_list` table where the `Maker` is 'General Motors' or the `Weight` is greater than 3500. However, there is no `Weight` column in the `model_list` table, and the query does not join with the `cars_data` table to check the weight of the cars. Therefore, this query is incorrect because it assumes that the `Weight` column exists in the `model_list` table, which it does not according to the given schema.\n\nSince Q2 is based on an incorrect assumption about the database schema and does not perform the necessary joins to obtain the weight information, it cannot be equivalent to Q1.

Q1 joins on `CAR_NAMES.MakeId = CARS_DATA.Id`, while Q2 joins on `model_list.ModelId = cars_data.Id`. According to the database schema, `cars_data.Id` is a primary key for `cars_data` and is used as a foreign key in different contexts for `car_names` and `model_list`.\n\nGiven the foreign key relationships, `car_names.MakeId` is not necessarily the same as `model_list.ModelId`, even though they both reference `cars_data.Id`. This means that the two queries could potentially join different rows from `cars_data` with different rows from `CAR_NAMES` and `model_list`.\n\nTo create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, we can construct an example database where `car_names.MakeId` and `model_list.ModelId` reference different `cars_data.Id` values for cars with 4 cylinders.

Q2 would return 'ModelB' because it joins `model_list.ModelId` with `cars_data.Id` where `ModelId` is 2.\n\nSince the two queries can produce different results based on the join conditions and the data in the tables, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Model FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId  =  T2.Id WHERE T2.Cylinders  =  4 ORDER BY T2.horsepower DESC LIMIT 1;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT model_list.Model FROM model_list JOIN cars_data ON model_list.ModelId = cars_data.Id WHERE cars_data.Cylinders = 4 ORDER BY cars_data.Horsepower DESC LIMIT 1;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The key difference between the two queries lies in the join conditions and the tables they reference.\n\nIn Q1, the join is between `CAR_NAMES` and `CARS_DATA` using the `MakeId` and `Id` columns, respectively. This suggests that `CARS_DATA.Id` is meant to represent the same entity as `CAR_NAMES.MakeId`.\n\nIn Q2, there are multiple joins involving `model_list`, `car_names`, `car_makers`, and `cars_data`. The join between `model_list` and `car_names` uses `model_list.ModelId = car_names.Model`, which is different from the join condition in Q1. Additionally, the join between `car_names` and `cars_data` is again on `car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id`, but there is also a join between `car_names` and `car_makers` on `car_names.MakeId = car_makers.Id`.\n\nThe discrepancy arises because Q2 includes an additional join with `model_list` and `car_makers`, which is not present in Q1. This additional join could filter the results differently based on the `ModelId` and `Maker` columns in `model_list`, and the `Id` column in `car_makers`.\n\nHere is a counterexample that would yield different results for Q1 and Q2:\n\nLet's assume we have the following data:\n\nTable `car_makers`:\n```\nId | Maker | FullName | Country\n--------------------------------\n1  | Ford  | Ford Inc | USA\n```\n\nTable `car_names`:\n```\nMakeId | Model | Make\n---------------------\n1      | Focus | Ford\n```\n\nTable `cars_data`:\n```\nId | MPG | Cylinders | Edispl | Horsepower | Weight | Accelerate | Year\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1  | 30  | 4         | 2.0    | 150        | 2000   | 8.0        | 2020\n```\n\nTable `model_list`:\n```\nModelId | Maker | Model\n-----------------------\n2       | 1     | Fiesta\n```\n\nGiven this data, Q1 would return the model \"Focus\" because it joins `car_names` and `cars_data` directly and finds the car with 4 cylinders and the highest horsepower.\n\nHowever, Q2 would not return any results because there is no `ModelId` in `model_list` that matches the `Model` in `car_names`.

Additionally, Q1 uses `T1.Maker = T4.Id` to join `MODEL_LIST` with `CAR_MAKERS`, whereas Q2 uses `car_names.MakeId = car_makers.Id` to join `CAR_NAMES` with `CAR_MAKERS`.\n\nHere is a counterexample that would yield different results for Q1 and Q2:\n\nLet's assume we have the following data:\n\nTable `model_list`:\n| ModelId | Maker | Model |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 10    | A     |\n| 2       | 20    | B     |\n\nTable `car_names`:\n| MakeId | Model | Make |\n|--------|-------|------|\n| 10     | A     | Ford |\n| 20     | B     | Chevy|\n\nTable `car_makers`:\n| Id  | Maker | FullName            | Country |\n|-----|-------|---------------------|---------|\n| 10  | Ford  | Ford Motor Company  | USA     |\n| 20  | Chevy | Chevrolet           | USA     |\n\nTable `cars_data`:\n| Id  | Weight | ... |\n|-----|--------|-----|\n| 10  | 3400   | ... |\n| 20  | 3300   | ... |\n\nIn this example, `Model` in `model_list` and `car_names` is the same as `ModelId` in `model_list`. However, the `MakeId` in `car_names` corresponds to the `Id` in both `car_makers` and `cars_data`.\n\nWhen we run Q1, it will not return any results because there is no `Maker` with an `Id` of 10 or 20 in `car_makers` that is not 'Ford Motor Company' and has a car with a weight less than 3500.\n\nWhen we run Q2, it will return the model 'B' from `model_list` because there is a `MakeId` of 20 in `car_names` that joins with `car_makers` where `Maker` is not 'Ford Motor Company' and joins with `cars_data` where the weight is less than 3500.\n\nSince Q1 and Q2 yield different results with this example database, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT DISTINCT T1.model FROM MODEL_LIST AS T1 JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T2 ON T1.Model  =  T2.Model JOIN CARS_DATA AS T3 ON T2.MakeId  =  T3.Id JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T4 ON T1.Maker  =  T4.Id WHERE T3.weight  <  3500 AND T4.FullName != 'Ford Motor Company';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT model_list.Model FROM model_list INNER JOIN car_names ON model_list.ModelId = car_names.Model INNER JOIN car_makers ON car_names.MakeId = car_makers.Id INNER JOIN cars_data ON car_names.MakeId = cars_data.Id WHERE cars_data.Weight < 3500 AND car_makers.Maker != 'Ford Motor Company';```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It does this by joining the countries table with the car_makers table and selecting the countries that have a match (i.e., there is at least one car maker in that country).\n\nQ2 uses a LEFT JOIN to combine the countries and car_makers tables and then filters the result with a WHERE clause to include only those rows where there is no matching entry in the car_makers table (i.e., car_makers.Id IS NULL). This effectively filters out the countries that have car makers, leaving only those without.\n\nBoth queries will produce the same result set for any given database because they are both designed to identify the same set of countries. The LEFT JOIN combined with the WHERE clause in Q2 is functionally equivalent to the EXCEPT operation in Q1.\n\nTo further illustrate their equivalence, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1.

The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are applied to the joined tables `car_makers`, `model_list`, and `car_names`, and the `INTERSECT` operator is used to find the common results between two subqueries.\n\nQ2 is selecting car maker IDs and makers based on two completely different subqueries that are not related to the number of models or car names. Instead, it's looking for car maker IDs that have at least two distinct models (which is not specified in Q1) and also have more than three distinct countries (which is not specified in Q1 either). The `COUNT(DISTINCT Country)` part is particularly problematic because the `car_makers` table does not have a direct relationship with multiple countries; each car maker is associated with only one country.\n\nTo illustrate the non-equivalence with an example, consider the following database content:\n\ncar_makers:\n| Id | Maker | Country |\n|----|-------|---------|\n| 1  | A     | 1       |\n| 2  | B     | 2       |\n\ncountries:\n| CountryId | CountryName | Continent |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| 1         | USA         | 1         |\n| 2         | Japan       | 2         |\n\nmodel_list:\n| ModelId | Maker | Model |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 1     | M1    |\n| 2       | 1     | M2    |\n| 3       | 2     | M3    |\n| 4       | 2     | M4    |\n\ncar_names:\n| MakeId | Model | Make |\n|--------|-------|------|\n| 1      | M1    | A    |\n| 1      | M2    | A    |\n| 1      | M2    | A    |\n| 1      | M2    | A    |\n| 2      | M3    | B    |\n| 2      | M4    | B    |\n| 2      | M4    | B    |\n| 2      | M4    | B    |\n\nIn this example, Q1 would return the maker with ID 1 because it has at least two models (M1 and M2) and more than three car names associated with those models (four entries for model M2).

SQL is generally case-insensitive for keywords, but the case sensitivity for table names and column names depends on the database system being used and its collation settings. In most SQL databases, keywords (like SELECT, FROM, WHERE) and function names are case-insensitive. This means that \"SELECT\" is the same as \"select\", \"FROM\" is the same as \"from\", and \"WHERE\" is the same as \"where\".\n\n2. The string comparison in SQL is also case-sensitive or case-insensitive based on the collation of the database or the specific column. In the given queries, the string \"Aberdeen\" is compared in the same way in both Q1 and Q2, assuming the default collation does not differentiate between single quotes and double quotes for string literals.\n\n3. Given that the table name \"AIRPORTS\" in Q1 and \"airports\" in Q2 is the only difference in terms of case, and assuming the database system treats table names in a case-insensitive manner, both queries are equivalent. They both select the \"AirportName\" from the \"airports\" table where the \"City\" is \"Aberdeen\".\n\n4.

Specifically, Q1 joins the `FLIGHTS` table with the `AIRLINES` table using `T3.uid = T1.Airline`, while Q2 uses `airlines.Abbreviation = flights.Airline`. This suggests that the `uid` column in the `AIRLINES` table is not necessarily the same as the `Abbreviation` column.\n\nAdditionally, Q1 filters on `T3.Airline = \"United Airlines\"`, which implies that it is looking for a match in the `Airline` column of the `AIRLINES` table. Q2 also filters on `airlines.Airline = 'United Airlines'`, which is consistent with Q1.\n\nGiven the schema information provided, we can see that the primary key for the `airlines` table is `uid`, not `Abbreviation`. This means that the `Abbreviation` column is not guaranteed to be unique or to match the `uid` column, which is used to join with the `flights` table in Q1.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to construct a counterexample where the `Abbreviation` does not match the `uid` for \"United Airlines\", which would cause the two queries to yield different results.\n\nHere is an example of such a counterexample:\n\nLet's say we have the following data in the `airlines` table:\n\n| uid | Airline           | Abbreviation | Country |\n|-----|-------------------|--------------|---------|\n| 1   | United Airlines   | UA           | USA     |\n| 2   | United Air        | UA           | USA     |\n\nAnd the `flights` table has:\n\n| Airline | FlightNo | SourceAirport | DestAirport |\n|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|\n| UA      | 1234     | SFO           | ABZ         |\n\nAnd the `airports` table has:\n\n| City     | AirportCode | AirportName | Country | CountryAbbrev |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------------|\n| Aberdeen | ABZ         | Aberdeen    | UK      | GB            |\n\nIn this case, Q1 would count flights operated by the airline with `uid` matching the `Airline` column in the `flights` table, which is \"United Airlines\" with `uid` 1. However, Q2 would count flights where the `Abbreviation` matches the `Airline` column in the `flights` table, which could include flights by \"United Air\" with `uid` 2 if its abbreviation is also \"UA\".\n\nSince there is a possibility of different results due to the different join conditions, the two queries are not guaranteed to be equivalent for all possible databases.\n\nTHE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) FROM FLIGHTS AS T1 JOIN AIRPORTS AS T2 ON T1.DestAirport  =  T2.AirportCode JOIN AIRLINES AS T3 ON T3.uid  =  T1.Airline WHERE T2.City  =  \"Aberdeen\" AND T3.Airline  =  \"United Airlines\"```\n\nQ2:```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM flights  JOIN airlines ON airlines.Abbreviation = flights.Airline  JOIN airports ON airports.AirportCode = flights.DestAirport  WHERE airlines.Airline = 'United Airlines' AND airports.City = 'Aberdeen';```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Q1 does not have a deterministic way to break ties, as SQL does not guarantee an order of rows without an explicit ORDER BY clause in the GROUP BY aggregation. Therefore, if there is a tie, Q1 could return any of the airlines with the fewest flights.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will deterministically return the airline with the smallest `uid` in case of a tie because the subquery is ordered by `COUNT(*) ASC` and implicitly by the `Airline` (which corresponds to `uid`) due to the primary key constraint on the `airlines.uid` column.\n\nTo illustrate, if we add another flight for airline BA (uid 2) to the flights table:\n\n| Airline | FlightNo | SourceAirport | DestAirport |\n|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|\n| 2       | F004     | LHR           | JFK         |\n\nNow both airlines have the same number of flights (2 each).

This additional join does not change the result because the `WHERE` clause filters directly on `airports.AirportCode`, which is the same column used in the join condition with the `flights` table.\n\nTherefore, assuming that `flights.Airline` references `airlines.Abbreviation`, the two queries are semantically equivalent because they produce the same result set for all possible databases.\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT\n\nHowever, if the schema is such that `flights.Airline` references `airlines.uid`, then the two queries are not equivalent, and a counterexample database could be constructed where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical.\n\nSince the schema is not explicitly clear on this point, based on the typical database design principles and the information given, we assume the former case where `flights.Airline` references `airlines.Abbreviation`, leading to the conclusion that the queries are equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Airline FROM AIRLINES AS T1 JOIN FLIGHTS AS T2 ON T1.uid  =  T2.Airline WHERE T2.SourceAirport  =  \"AHD\"```\n\nQ2:```SELECT airlines.Airline  FROM airlines  JOIN flights ON airlines.Abbreviation = flights.Airline  JOIN airports ON flights.SourceAirport = airports.AirportCode  WHERE airports.AirportCode = 'AHD';```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The INTERSECT operator will return only the districts that appear in both result sets.

The subquery with the IN clause is selecting distinct districts with more than 10000 products. The main query then filters the shops with less than 3000 products to those that are in the same district as a shop with more than 10000 products.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1. If a district has shops both with less than 3000 products and with more than 10000 products, Q2 will return that district, while Q1 will not return any district because of the INTERSECT condition.\n\n2. If a district has only shops with less than 3000 products or only shops with more than 10000 products, neither Q1 nor Q2 will return that district.\n\n3. If a district has no shops or shops with a number of products between 3000 and 10000, neither Q1 nor Q2 will return that district.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can see that Q1 will always return an empty result set, while Q2 might return some districts under certain conditions. Therefore, the two queries are not equivalent.\n\nTo provide a counterexample, consider the following example database:\n\nshop table:\n| Shop_ID | Name   | Location | District | Number_products | Manager_name |\n|---------|--------|----------|----------|-----------------|--------------|\n| 1       | ShopA  | Loc1     | Dist1    | 2000            | Manager1     |\n| 2       | ShopB  | Loc2     | Dist1    | 11000           | Manager2     |\n| 3       | ShopC  | Loc3     | Dist2    | 5000            | Manager3     |\n\nFor this database, Q1 will return an empty result set because there are no districts that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. However, Q2 will return \"Dist1\" because there is a shop in Dist1 with less than 3000 products and another shop in the same district with more than 10000 products.\n\nSince we have found a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the answer is:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT district FROM shop WHERE Number_products  <  3000 INTERSECT SELECT district FROM shop WHERE Number_products  >  10000```\n\nQ2:```SELECT shop.District  FROM  shop  WHERE  shop.Number_products < 3000 AND  shop.District IN (     SELECT DISTINCT shop.District      FROM shop      WHERE shop.Number_products > 10000 )```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

There is also a template type C with no templates associated with it.\n\nNow let's execute the queries:\n\nQ1: SELECT template_type_code FROM Templates GROUP BY template_type_code HAVING count(*) < 3\nThis query will return:\n| template_type_code |\n|--------------------|\n| A                  |\n| B                  |\n\nQ2: SELECT Template_Type_Code FROM Ref_Template_Types WHERE Template_Type_Code IN (\n    SELECT Template_Type_Code\n    FROM Templates\n    GROUP BY Template_Type_Code\n    HAVING COUNT(Template_ID) < 3\n)\nThis query will return:\n| Template_Type_Code |\n|--------------------|\n| A                  |\n| B                  |\n\nAt first glance, it seems that the outputs are identical. However, the difference lies in the fact that Q1 only considers template types that have at least one template associated with them, while Q2 considers all template types from the Ref_Template_Types table, including those without any associated templates.\n\nTo create a counterexample where the outputs are not identical, we can modify the Templates table to have no templates associated with a certain template type, like C.\n\nTemplates (modified):\n| Template_ID | Version_Number | Template_Type_Code | Date_Effective_From | Date_Effective_To | Template_Details |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| (no rows)   |                |                    |                     |                   |                  |\n\nNow, let's execute the queries again:\n\nQ1: SELECT template_type_code FROM Templates GROUP BY template_type_code HAVING count(*) < 3\nThis query will return no rows because there are no templates.\n\nQ2: SELECT Template_Type_Code FROM Ref_Template_Types WHERE Template_Type_Code IN (\n    SELECT Template_Type_Code\n    FROM Templates\n    GROUP BY Template_Type_Code\n    HAVING COUNT(Template_ID) < 3\n)\nThis query will still return no rows because the subquery will not return any template type codes (since there are no templates).\n\nHowever, if we consider a template type that exists in Ref_Template_Types but has no associated templates in the Templates table, Q2 would include that template type in its result set if we modify the subquery condition to allow for zero count. Since Q1 only considers template types with associated templates, it would not include such a template type in its result set.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent because there can be a scenario where Q2 includes template types with zero associated templates, while Q1 does not.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT template_type_code FROM Templates GROUP BY template_type_code HAVING count(*)  <  3```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Template_Type_Code  FROM Ref_Template_Types  WHERE Template_Type_Code IN (     SELECT Template_Type_Code      FROM Templates      GROUP BY Template_Type_Code      HAVING COUNT(Template_ID) < 3  )```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Here's how:\n\nConsider a scenario where there is a `template_type_code` in the `Templates` table that does not exist in the `Ref_Template_Types` table. According to the schema, `Templates.Template_Type_Code` is a foreign key that references `Ref_Template_Types.Template_Type_Code`, but let's assume there is a data integrity issue and this constraint is not enforced, allowing for orphaned records in the `Templates` table.\n\nHere's an example of such data:\n\nTemplates Table:\n| Template_ID | Version_Number | Template_Type_Code | Date_Effective_From | Date_Effective_To | Template_Details |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1           | 1              | BK                 | 2021-01-01          | NULL              | Template 1       |\n| 2           | 1              | OR                 | 2021-01-01          | NULL              | Template 2       |\n\nDocuments Table:\n| Document_ID | Template_ID | Document_Name    | Document_Description | Other_Details |\n|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| 1           | 1           | Document 1       | Description 1        | Details 1     |\n| 2           | 2           | Document 2       | Description 2        | Details 2     |\n\nRef_Template_Types Table:\n| Template_Type_Code | Template_Type_Description |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| BK                 | Book                      |\n|                    |                           |  <-- Note: 'OR' code is missing\n\nIn this case, Q1 would return \"Document 1\" because it joins `Templates` with `Documents` directly and filters on `template_type_code = \"BK\"`, which exists in the `Templates` table.\n\nHowever, Q2 would not return any results because it includes an additional join with `Ref_Template_Types`, and since there is no 'OR' `template_type_code` in `Ref_Template_Types`, the join condition fails, and no rows are returned.\n\nThis example shows that Q1 and Q2 can produce different results, and therefore, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.document_name FROM Templates AS T1 JOIN Documents AS T2 ON T1.template_id  =  T2.template_id WHERE T1.template_type_code  =  \"BK\"```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Documents.Document_Name  FROM Documents  INNER JOIN Templates ON Documents.Template_ID = Templates.Template_ID  INNER JOIN Ref_Template_Types ON Templates.Template_Type_Code = Ref_Template_Types.Template_Type_Code  WHERE Ref_Template_Types.Template_Type_Code = 'BK'```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It then filters the results where the template_type_code is 'BK'.\n\nAt first glance, the queries seem to be equivalent because they both filter on the template_type_code being 'BK' and join the Documents and Templates tables on template_id.

This means that the additional join in Q2 with the Ref_Template_Types table should not filter out any additional rows because it is guaranteed that a matching template_type_code exists in the Ref_Template_Types table for every template_type_code in the Templates table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given schema and constraints, Q1 and Q2 should be semantically equivalent because the additional join in Q2 does not change the result set.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely certain, let's consider if we can create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 would not be identical:\n\nSince the foreign key constraint ensures that every template_type_code in the Templates table has a corresponding entry in the Ref_Template_Types table, there is no way to create a counterexample where the outputs would differ.

Since `Document 4` does not have a `Template_ID`, it will not be included in the count. The output will be:\n\n```\n+-------------------+----------+\n| template_type_code | count(*) |\n+-------------------+----------+\n| A                 | 2        |\n| B                 | 1        |\n+-------------------+----------+\n```\n\nQ2 will first join `Ref_Template_Types` with `Templates` on `Template_Type_Code` and then with `Documents` on `Template_ID`. It uses a `LEFT JOIN`, so it will include all `Template_Type_Code` from `Ref_Template_Types` even if there are no corresponding `Template_ID` in `Documents`. It also uses `COUNT(DISTINCT Documents.Document_ID)` which will count distinct `Document_ID`s. The output will be:\n\n```\n+-------------------+----------------------------------+\n| Template_Type_Code | COUNT(DISTINCT Documents.Document_ID) |\n+-------------------+----------------------------------+\n| A                 | 2                                |\n| B                 | 1                                |\n+-------------------+----------------------------------+\n```\n\nIn this case, the outputs are identical. However, if we modify the `Documents` table to include a `Document_ID` with a `NULL` `Template_ID`, the outputs will differ. For example:\n\n```\nDocuments\n+-------------+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+\n| Document_ID | Template_ID | Document_Name     | Document_Description |\n+-------------+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+\n| 1           | 1           | Document 1        | Description 1       |\n| 2           | 1           | Document 2        | Description 2       |\n| 3           | 2           | Document 3        | Description 3       |\n| 4           | NULL        | Document 4        | Description 4       |\n| 5           | NULL        | Document 5        | Description 5       |\n+-------------+-------------+-------------------+---------------------+\n```\n\nNow, Q1 will still produce the same result because it only counts documents with a valid `Template_ID`. However, Q2 will include the `NULL` `Template_ID` documents in the count for each `Template_Type_Code` because of the `LEFT JOIN`. The output for Q2 will now be:\n\n```\n+-------------------+----------------------------------+\n| Template_Type_Code | COUNT(DISTINCT Documents.Document_ID) |\n+-------------------+----------------------------------+\n| A                 | 3                                | (includes Document_ID 1, 2, and NULL)\n| B                 | 2                                | (includes Document_ID 3 and NULL)\n+-------------------+----------------------------------+\n```\n\nSince we can create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.template_type_code ,  count(*) FROM Templates AS T1 JOIN Documents AS T2 ON T1.template_id  =  T2.template_id GROUP BY T1.template_type_code```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Ref_Template_Types.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(DISTINCT Documents.Document_ID)   FROM Ref_Template_Types   LEFT JOIN Templates ON Ref_Template_Types.Template_Type_Code = Templates.Template_Type_Code   LEFT JOIN Documents ON Templates.Template_ID = Documents.Template_ID   GROUP BY Ref_Template_Types.Template_Type_Code```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The only differences between the two queries are the case sensitivity of the SQL keywords and the use of double quotes in Q1 and single quotes in Q2 for the string literal 'AD'.\n\nIn standard SQL, keywords are not case-sensitive, meaning `SELECT` is the same as `select`. Similarly, identifiers such as table and column names are also not case-sensitive in most SQL database systems, although this can vary based on the database's collation settings. However, the default behavior in the majority of SQL databases is to treat identifiers case-insensitively.\n\nRegarding the string literals, in SQL, single quotes are used to denote string literals, and double quotes are typically used to denote identifiers (such as column names or aliases). However, some SQL databases, like MySQL, allow double quotes to be used interchangeably with single quotes for string literals if the SQL mode is not set to ANSI_QUOTES.\n\nGiven that the database schema does not specify any particular SQL database system or collation settings that would affect the case sensitivity of identifiers or the interpretation of string literals, we can assume the default behavior where these aspects are not case-sensitive and double quotes can be used for string literals.\n\nTherefore, without any specific database settings that would cause a difference, Q1 and Q2 are semantically equivalent and will yield identical results for all possible databases following the given schema.

Since there are two templates with Template_Type_Code 1, and both are used in documents, the DISTINCT keyword would ensure that \"Type A\" appears only once in the result set.\n\nQ2 would select from Templates and join with Documents. The GROUP BY clause would group the results by Template_Type_Description, which would also ensure that each description appears only once in the result set.\n\nAt first glance, it seems that both queries would produce the same result set for this example database. However, the difference lies in the fact that Q1 includes the Ref_template_types table in the join, which means it would only return template type descriptions that exist in the Ref_template_types table.\n\nTo create a counterexample, we can modify the Templates table to include a template that does not have a corresponding entry in the Ref_template_types table:\n\nTemplates (modified):\n| Template_ID | Version_Number | Template_Type_Code | ... |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------------|-----|\n| 10          | 1              | 1                  | ... |\n| 20          | 1              | 2                  | ... |\n| 30          | 1              | 1                  | ... |\n| 40          | 1              | 3                  | ... |  <-- No corresponding entry in Ref_template_types\n\nDocuments (modified):\n| Document_ID | Template_ID | ... |\n|-------------|-------------|-----|\n| 100         | 10          | ... |\n| 200         | 20          | ... |\n| 300         | 30          | ... |\n| 400         | 40          | ... |  <-- Uses Template_ID 40\n\nNow, Q1 would not return a description for Template_Type_Code 3 because there is no corresponding entry in Ref_template_types. However, Q2 would still return the Template_Type_Description for Template_ID 40 if it exists in the Templates table, regardless of whether it has a corresponding entry in Ref_template_types.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent because there can be a scenario where Q2 returns more results than Q1 due to the lack of a join with the Ref_template_types table in Q2.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT DISTINCT T1.template_type_description FROM Ref_template_types AS T1 JOIN Templates AS T2 ON T1.template_type_code  = T2.template_type_code JOIN Documents AS T3 ON T2.Template_ID  =  T3.template_ID```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Templates.Template_Type_Description FROM Templates INNER JOIN Documents ON Templates.Template_ID = Documents.Template_ID GROUP BY Templates.Template_Type_Description```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It groups the results by T1.document_id (which is Paragraphs.document_id) and does not explicitly include T2.document_name (which is Documents.document_name) in the GROUP BY clause. However, because T1.document_id is a foreign key to T2.document_id and it's grouped by T1.document_id, it implicitly groups by T2.document_id and hence T2.document_name as well due to the functional dependency. The COUNT(*) will count the number of rows resulting from the join, including rows with NULL values in the Paragraphs table.\n\nQ2 uses a LEFT JOIN, which means it will return all rows from the Documents table, and the matching rows from the Paragraphs table. If there is no match, the columns from Paragraphs will contain NULL. It groups the results by both Documents.Document_ID and Documents.Document_Name, and counts the number of Paragraphs.Paragraph_ID, which will not count NULL values (rows without a matching paragraph).\n\nThe difference between COUNT(*) in Q1 and COUNT(Paragraphs.Paragraph_ID) in Q2 is significant when there are documents with no paragraphs.

In this case, Q1 would group these two teachers together because it groups by name, potentially resulting in a count of 2 or more even if each teacher only has one course arrangement. Q2, on the other hand, would not group these teachers together because it groups by the unique `Teacher_ID`.\n\nHere's an example database that illustrates this point:\n\n```\nteacher\n+------------+------+-----+----------+\n| Teacher_ID | Name | Age | Hometown |\n+------------+------+-----+----------+\n|          1 | John |  40 | TownA    |\n|          2 | John |  35 | TownB    |\n+------------+------+-----+----------+\n\ncourse_arrange\n+-----------+------------+-------+\n| Course_ID | Teacher_ID | Grade |\n+-----------+------------+-------+\n|       101 |          1 |     A |\n|       102 |          2 |     B |\n+-----------+------------+-------+\n```\n\nIn this example, each teacher named \"John\" has only one course arrangement, but Q1 would count them together because it groups by name, resulting in a count of 2.

Let's analyze both queries:\n\nQ1 uses a subquery to find the `Teacher_id` values that are present in the `course_arrange` table and then selects the names of teachers whose `Teacher_id` is not in that list.\n\nQ2 uses a `LEFT JOIN` to join the `teacher` table with the `course_arrange` table on `Teacher_ID`. It then selects the names of teachers where the corresponding `Course_ID` from the `course_arrange` table is `NULL`, which indicates that there was no match (i.e., the teacher is not assigned to any course).\n\nBoth queries will yield the same result for all possible databases because they are both looking for teachers without any course assignments. The `NOT IN` subquery in Q1 and the `LEFT JOIN` with a `NULL` check in Q2 are two different ways to achieve the same goal.\n\nTo further confirm their equivalence, let's consider the following example database:\n\nteacher:\n| Teacher_ID | Name  |\n|------------|-------|\n| 1          | Alice |\n| 2          | Bob   |\n| 3          | Carol |\n\ncourse_arrange:\n| Course_ID | Teacher_ID | Grade |\n|-----------|------------|-------|\n| 101       | 1          | A     |\n| 102       | 2          | B     |\n\nFor this example, Q1 would select \"Carol\" because her `Teacher_ID` (3) is not in the `course_arrange` table.

Q1 does this by selecting teachers whose IDs do not appear in the `course_arrange` table.

Since the `LEFT JOIN` in Q2 is specifically looking for cases where there is no match in `course_arrange` (the same condition that Q1 is looking for with the `NOT IN` subquery), the two queries are semantically equivalent.\n\nIt is important to note that this equivalence holds true under the assumption that `Teacher_ID` in the `course_arrange` table cannot be `NULL`. If `Teacher_ID` could be `NULL`, then the `NOT IN` subquery in Q1 would not return any results if there were any `NULL` values in the `Teacher_ID` column of `course_arrange`, because `NOT IN` is undefined when there are `NULL` values.

The `HAVING` clause ensures that only players who have distinct winning years equal to 2 are selected.\n\nHowever, Q2 has a potential issue. The `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT strftime('%Y', tourney_date)) = 2` clause requires that the player must have won in two distinct years within the filtered set (which is only 2013 due to the WHERE clause).

This query will return the player with the most wins, but it does not guarantee that the winner_rank_points returned are the maximum for that player.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, selects the winner_name and the maximum ranking points from a subquery that counts the total wins and gets the maximum winner_rank_points for each winner_id. It then joins with the players table and filters to only include the player(s) with the maximum total wins.

Therefore, for the given schema and the assumption that `player_id` cannot be NULL, the queries are equivalent.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the results to be identical for all possible databases, including those where `player_id` could potentially be NULL (even though it's against the schema definition).

This count includes duplicates if there are multiple degree programs associated with the same department.\n\nQ2 counts the number of distinct degree_program_id values from the Degree_Programs table where the department name is 'engineering'.

Q1 uses a subquery with NOT IN to exclude semesters that have at least one student enrolled. Q2 uses a LEFT JOIN to include all semesters and then filters out those that have a matching entry in the Student_Enrolment table, effectively leaving only semesters with no students enrolled.\n\nThe key to the equivalence of these two queries lies in the handling of NULL values. In Q1, if there are NULL values in the Student_Enrolment.semester_id column, the NOT IN condition will not behave as expected because NOT IN will not match NULLs. However, in Q2, the LEFT JOIN combined with the IS NULL check on the Student_Enrolment.student_enrolment_id column will correctly identify semesters with no student enrolments, even if there are NULL values in the Student_Enrolment.semester_id column.\n\nSince the database schema does not indicate that the Student_Enrolment.semester_id column allows NULLs (as it is part of a foreign key relationship), we can assume that there will be no NULL values in that column.

In Q2, because of the incorrect join condition, the count may not correctly reflect the number of students enrolled in the course, as it attempts to match section IDs with course IDs, which are not related in the way the query assumes.\n\nHere's a simple counterexample:\n\nLet's say we have one course with two sections:\n\nCourses table:\n| course_id | course_name |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| 1         | Math 101    |\n\nSections table:\n| section_id | course_id | section_name |\n|------------|-----------|--------------|\n| 1          | 1         | A            |\n| 2          | 1         | B            |\n\nStudent_Enrolment_Courses table:\n| student_course_id | course_id | student_enrolment_id |\n|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| 1                 | 1         | 1                    |\n| 2                 | 2         | 2                    |\n\nIn this case, Q1 would count 2 enrollments for \"Math 101\" because it's looking at the `course_id` directly. However, Q2 would not count any enrollments correctly because it's trying to match `section_id` with `course_id` in the `Student_Enrolment_Courses` table, which does not make sense in the schema. Thus, Q2 would likely return incorrect results or no results at all, depending on the data in the `Student_Enrolment` table.\n\nTherefore, Q1 and Q2 are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT  T1.course_name FROM Courses AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses AS T2 ON T1.course_id  =  T2.course_id GROUP BY T1.course_name ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Courses.course_name  FROM Courses  JOIN Sections ON Courses.course_id = Sections.course_id  JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses ON Sections.section_id = Student_Enrolment_Courses.course_id  JOIN Student_Enrolment ON Student_Enrolment_Courses.student_enrolment_id = Student_Enrolment.student_enrolment_id  GROUP BY Courses.course_name  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC  LIMIT 1;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In Q2, the join between `Sections` and `Student_Enrolment_Courses` is incorrectly using `Sections.section_id = Student_Enrolment_Courses.course_id`. This condition is joining a `section_id` with a `course_id`, which are not meant to be equivalent fields based on the database schema provided.\n\nThe correct join condition should be `Sections.course_id = Student_Enrolment_Courses.course_id`, which would match the join condition used in Q1.

In Q1, the `Addresses` table is joined with the `Students` table to filter students based on the `state_province_county` column in the `Addresses` table. However, in Q2, the `Students` table is directly filtered on a non-existent `state_province_county` column. The `Students` table does not have a `state_province_county` column according to the schema provided; this column is in the `Addresses` table.\n\n2. Q1 uses the `EXCEPT` keyword to subtract the set of students who are enrolled (found in the `Student_Enrolment` table) from the set of students who live in 'NorthCarolina'. Q2 attempts to achieve a similar result by using a `NOT EXISTS` subquery to exclude students who are enrolled.\n\n3. There is a typo in Q2 where 'North Carolina' is written with a space, while in Q1 it is 'NorthCarolina' without a space. This would cause the queries to return different results even if the schema issue in point 1 was not present.\n\nTo illustrate the non-equivalence with an example, consider the following scenario:\n\n- There is a student with `student_id = 1`, `last_name = 'Doe'`, and `current_address_id = 2`.\n- The address with `address_id = 2` has `state_province_county = 'NorthCarolina'`.\n- The student with `student_id = 1` is enrolled in a course, so there is a corresponding entry in the `Student_Enrolment` table.\n\nFor Q1, this student's last name would not appear in the result because they are enrolled in a course, and their name would be subtracted by the `EXCEPT` clause.\n\nFor Q2, assuming the typo is fixed and the schema issue is corrected by joining the `Students` table with the `Addresses` table to check the `state_province_county`, the student would still not appear in the result because of the `NOT EXISTS` subquery.\n\nHowever, if the typo in Q2 is not fixed, or if the schema issue is not corrected, the results would be different. Even with the schema corrected and the typo fixed, the queries are not equivalent because Q1 uses `EXCEPT` with `DISTINCT`, which ensures that duplicate last names are removed from the result set, while Q2 does not have such a mechanism and could potentially include duplicates if the `Students` table contains students with the same last name, living in North Carolina, and not enrolled.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.last_name FROM Students AS T1 JOIN Addresses AS T2 ON T1.current_address_id  =  T2.address_id WHERE T2.state_province_county  =  'NorthCarolina' EXCEPT SELECT DISTINCT T3.last_name FROM Students AS T3 JOIN Student_Enrolment AS T4 ON T3.student_id  =  T4.student_id```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Students.last_name  FROM Students  WHERE Students.state_province_county = 'North Carolina'  AND NOT EXISTS  (SELECT 1 FROM Student_Enrolment WHERE Student_Enrolment.student_id = Students.student_id)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

This means that if there are multiple students who registered on the same earliest date, Q1 will return the first one based on the default ordering of the rows in the database (which could be by student_id or any other implicit order defined by the database if there is no explicit ORDER BY clause for other columns).\n\nQ2, on the other hand, selects the student(s) whose registration date is the minimum registration date in the entire Students table.

Q1 might return John Doe if the implicit order is by student_id, while Q2 could return either John Doe or Jane Smith, depending on how the database resolves the WHERE clause subquery when there are multiple minimum values.\n\nTo create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, you would need at least two students with the same earliest registration date.

It does not consider the permanent addresses at all, and it does not retrieve any address details.\n\nQ2 retrieves all the details of addresses that are either current or permanent addresses of students. It does not count the addresses, and it includes all the details of each address that is linked to a student, potentially listing the same address multiple times if it is used as both a current and permanent address by any student.\n\nTo illustrate the difference with an example, consider the following database content:\n\nAddresses Table:\n| address_id | line_1       | ... | country |\n|------------|--------------|-----|---------|\n| 1          | 123 Main St. | ... | USA     |\n| 2          | 456 Elm St.  | ... | USA     |\n| 3          | 789 Oak St.  | ... | USA     |\n\nStudents Table:\n| student_id | current_address_id | permanent_address_id | ... |\n|------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----|\n| 1          | 1                  | 2                    | ... |\n| 2          | 2                  | 3                    | ... |\n| 3          | 1                  | 3                    | ... |\n\nQ1 would return a count of 2, because there are two distinct current addresses (address_id 1 and 2).\n\nQ2 would return the details of all three addresses, because each is used at least once as either a current or permanent address. If any address is used as both a current and permanent address for a student, it would appear twice in the results.\n\nTherefore, Q1 and Q2 are not equivalent.

It then checks if the 'permanent_address_id' of a student is in the list of 'address_id' returned by the subquery or if the 'cell_mobile_number' matches the specified number.\n\nBoth queries will yield the same result set for any given database because they apply the same logical conditions to filter the students.

In Q1, the `TV_Channel` table is joined with the `TV_series` table using the `id` field, and the `series_name` is used to filter the results. In Q2, the `Channel` field in the `TV_series` table is directly compared to the string 'Sky Radio'.\n\nHere's why they are not equivalent:\n\nIn Q1, the `WHERE` clause is filtering on the `series_name` column of the `TV_Channel` table, which means it is looking for a channel with the name \"Sky Radio\". The `JOIN` condition is using the `id` field to match records between `TV_Channel` and `TV_series`, so it will only return episodes from the series that are broadcasted on the channel with the name \"Sky Radio\".\n\nIn Q2, the `WHERE` clause is filtering on the `Channel` column of the `TV_series` table, which is a foreign key to the `TV_Channel` table's `id` field. This query assumes that the `Channel` field contains the name of the channel, which is incorrect according to the given schema. The `Channel` field should contain the `id` of the channel, not its name.\n\nTo illustrate with an example:\n\nLet's say we have the following data:\n\nTV_Channel table:\n| id | series_name | ... |\n|----|-------------|-----|\n| 1  | Sky Radio   | ... |\n| 2  | Other Show  | ... |\n\nTV_series table:\n| id | Episode | Channel |\n|----|---------|---------|\n| 1  | Ep1     | 1       |\n| 2  | Ep2     | 1       |\n| 3  | Ep3     | 2       |\n\nQ1 would return:\n| Episode |\n|---------|\n| Ep1     |\n| Ep2     |\n\nQ2 would return an empty result set because there is no channel with the name 'Sky Radio' in the `Channel` field of the `TV_series` table.\n\nTo create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, we can simply use the schema and data provided above.

The subquery in Q1 explicitly filters out `People_ID` values that are present in the `poker_player` table. However, if there are any NULL values in the `poker_player.People_ID` column, the `NOT IN` clause will not work as expected because `NOT IN` is NULL-safe, meaning that the comparison with NULL yields unknown, and the row will not be included in the result set.\n\nOn the other hand, Q2 uses a `LEFT JOIN` to include all rows from the `people` table and the matching rows from the `poker_player` table, if any. The `WHERE poker_player.People_ID IS NULL` condition in Q2 filters out all rows that did not find a match in the `poker_player` table, including those with NULL `People_ID` in the `poker_player` table.\n\nTo demonstrate the difference, consider the following example database:\n\nTable `people`:\n```\nPeople_ID | Name\n----------|-----\n1         | Alice\n2         | Bob\n3         | Charlie\n```\n\nTable `poker_player`:\n```\nPoker_Player_ID | People_ID | ...\n----------------|-----------\n1               | 1         | ...\n2               | NULL      | ...\n```\n\nFor Q1, the subquery `SELECT People_ID FROM poker_player` will return 1 and NULL. Since `NOT IN` is not NULL-safe, the main query will not return any results because the comparison with NULL yields unknown.\n\nFor Q2, the `LEFT JOIN` will produce the following intermediate result:\n```\npeople.People_ID | people.Name | poker_player.People_ID\n-----------------|-------------|-----------------------\n1                | Alice       | 1\n2                | Bob         | NULL\n3                | Charlie     | NULL\n```\n\nAfter applying the `WHERE poker_player.People_ID IS NULL` condition, Q2 will return:\n```\nName\n-----\nBob\nCharlie\n```\n\nSince Q1 returns no results and Q2 returns Bob and Charlie, the queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT Name FROM people WHERE People_ID NOT IN (SELECT People_ID FROM poker_player)```\n\nQ2:```SELECT people.Name FROM people LEFT JOIN poker_player ON people.People_ID = poker_player.People_ID WHERE poker_player.People_ID IS NULL;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

According to the database, only CountryA has both English and Dutch, so the result of Q1 is 1.\n\nQ2 selects the count of distinct `CountryCode` from `countrylanguage` where the language is either English or Dutch, but it also restricts the `CountryCode` to those that have both English and Dutch as per the subquery with the INTERSECT clause. The subquery with INTERSECT will return only CountryCode A, because it's the only country that has both languages. However, the outer query is counting distinct `CountryCode` where the language is either English or Dutch, which includes countries A, B, and C. Since the subquery restricts the `CountryCode` to A, the result of Q2 is also 1.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem that the queries are equivalent based on this example. However, the difference lies in the fact that Q1 is directly counting the number of countries that have both languages, while Q2 is counting the number of distinct country codes that have either language but also appear in the list of countries that have both languages.\n\nTo create a counterexample, we can add another entry to the `countrylanguage` table where a country has the same language listed twice:\n\n`countrylanguage` table (new entry):\n| CountryCode | Language | IsOfficial | Percentage |\n|-------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| B           | English  | True       | 80.0       |\n| B           | English  | False      | 20.0       |\n\nNow, Q1 still returns 1 because it's counting the number of countries that have both English and Dutch, which is unaffected by the new entry.\n\nHowever, Q2 will now return 2 because it's counting distinct `CountryCode` where the language is either English or Dutch, and since B has English listed twice (which is allowed in the `countrylanguage` table schema), it will be counted twice unless we use `DISTINCT`. But since the `DISTINCT` is applied to `CountryCode` and not to the combination of `CountryCode` and `Language`, the duplicate entry for English in country B does not affect the count. Therefore, Q2 still counts country A for having both English and Dutch, and country B for having English, resulting in a count of 2.\n\nThis counterexample shows that the two queries are not equivalent because they can produce different results under certain conditions.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT T1.Name FROM country AS T1 JOIN countrylanguage AS T2 ON T1.Code  =  T2.CountryCode WHERE T2.Language  =  \"English\" INTERSECT SELECT T1.Name FROM country AS T1 JOIN countrylanguage AS T2 ON T1.Code  =  T2.CountryCode WHERE T2.Language  =  \"Dutch\")```\n\nQ2:```SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cl.CountryCode) FROM countrylanguage cl WHERE cl.Language IN ('English', 'Dutch') AND cl.CountryCode IN (   SELECT cl2.CountryCode    FROM countrylanguage cl2    WHERE cl2.Language = 'English'   INTERSECT    SELECT cl3.CountryCode    FROM countrylanguage cl3    WHERE cl3.Language = 'Dutch' )```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It uses explicit table aliases (`t1`, `t2`, `t3`) and joins the `country` and `countrylanguage` tables on `countrycode`, and then joins the `city` table on `countrycode`.\n\nQ2 selects city names (`city.Name`) from the `city` table with similar join conditions on the `countrylanguage` and `country` tables. It also filters for `countrylanguage.Language = 'Chinese'`, `countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 'T'`, and `country.Continent = 'Asia'`. However, Q2 uses a `GROUP BY city.Name` clause instead of `SELECT DISTINCT`.\n\nAt first glance, both queries seem to be doing the same thing: they are selecting city names from Asian countries where Chinese is an official language. The difference lies in the use of `SELECT DISTINCT` in Q1 and `GROUP BY city.Name` in Q2.\n\nIn SQL, `SELECT DISTINCT` is used to remove duplicate rows from the result set. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to arrange identical data into groups with the `SELECT` statement often being used to aggregate the results.\n\nHowever, since Q2 does not use any aggregate functions (like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) and is only grouping by the city name, the `GROUP BY` clause effectively acts as a `DISTINCT` on `city.Name`. Therefore, in this specific case, the `GROUP BY` clause in Q2 should yield the same result as `SELECT DISTINCT` in Q1.\n\nNow, let's consider if there's a way to modify the example database such that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical. Since both queries are designed to return distinct city names and there are no aggregate functions used in Q2, there is no straightforward way to create a counterexample where the outputs would differ. The presence of duplicate city names in the `city` table would not affect the outcome because both queries are explicitly looking for unique names.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the analysis of the SQL queries, we can conclude that:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```select distinct t3.name from country as t1 join countrylanguage as t2 on t1.code  =  t2.countrycode join city as t3 on t1.code  =  t3.countrycode where t2.isofficial  =  't' and t2.language  =  'chinese' and t1.continent  =  \"asia\"```\n\nQ2:```SELECT city.Name  FROM city  JOIN countrylanguage ON city.CountryCode = countrylanguage.CountryCode  JOIN country ON city.CountryCode = country.Code  WHERE countrylanguage.Language = 'Chinese'  AND countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 'T'  AND country.Continent = 'Asia'  GROUP BY city.Name```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In SQL, the `WHERE` clause is evaluated before the `GROUP BY` clause, which means that in Q2, the `AVG(LifeExpectancy) < 72` condition is incorrectly placed and will result in an error because aggregate functions like `AVG` cannot be used in the `WHERE` clause directly. They must be used in the `HAVING` clause after the `GROUP BY` clause.\n\nQ1 correctly uses the `HAVING` clause to filter groups after they have been created by the `GROUP BY` clause. This means that Q1 will return the sum of populations and the average life expectancy for each continent where the average life expectancy is less than 72.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will not execute because of the misuse of the `AVG` function in the `WHERE` clause. If we were to correct Q2 by moving the `AVG(LifeExpectancy) < 72` condition to a `HAVING` clause, then the two queries would be equivalent. However, as written, Q2 is not a valid SQL query and therefore cannot be equivalent to Q1.\n\nTo illustrate with an example, let's assume we have a database with the following data:\n\n```\ncountry (Code, Name, Continent, LifeExpectancy, Population)\n('USA', 'United States', 'North America', 78.0, 328200000)\n('CAN', 'Canada', 'North America', 82.0, 37590000)\n('MEX', 'Mexico', 'North America', 75.0, 126200000)\n('BRA', 'Brazil', 'South America', 75.0, 209500000)\n('ARG', 'Argentina', 'South America', 76.0, 44940000)\n('NGA', 'Nigeria', 'Africa', 54.0, 200000000)\n('ZAF', 'South Africa', 'Africa', 63.0, 57780000)\n```\n\nQ1 would return:\n```\nsum(Population) | avg(LifeExpectancy) | Continent\n-------------------------------------------------\n257780000       | 58.5                | Africa\n```\n\nQ2 would not execute due to the error mentioned above. If we correct Q2 by replacing the `WHERE` clause with a `HAVING` clause, it would return the same result as Q1 for this dataset.

Since Alice is associated with more than one orchestra, her name will appear in the result set.\n\nQ2 will also return the name of the conductor who is associated with more than one distinct orchestra, but it groups by `conductor.Name` and uses `COUNT(DISTINCT orchestra.Orchestra_ID)`. This means it will count the distinct number of orchestras associated with each conductor's name. Again, Alice's name will appear in the result set.\n\nAt first glance, it seems that both queries will return the same result for this example.

Q2, however, will still count two distinct Orchestra_IDs for Alice. Therefore, Q1 will return Alice as the conductor with the most rows in the orchestra table, while Q2 will not be able to distinguish between Alice and Bob, and the result will depend on which conductor comes first in the result set.\n\nThis counterexample shows that Q1 and Q2 are not equivalent because they can produce different results for the same database.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Name FROM conductor AS T1 JOIN orchestra AS T2 ON T1.Conductor_ID  =  T2.Conductor_ID GROUP BY T2.Conductor_ID ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT conductor.Name FROM conductor JOIN orchestra ON conductor.Conductor_ID = orchestra.Conductor_ID GROUP BY conductor.Conductor_ID ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT orchestra.Orchestra_ID) DESC LIMIT 1;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, it specifically counts distinct `Performance_ID` values and filters for those orchestras that have more than one distinct performance.\n\nThe key difference between the two queries lies in the use of `COUNT(*)` in Q1 versus `COUNT(DISTINCT performance.Performance_ID)` in Q2. The `COUNT(*)` function counts all rows, including duplicates, while `COUNT(DISTINCT performance.Performance_ID)` counts only unique `Performance_ID` values.\n\n1.

Q1 would count the duplicate `Performance_ID` values as separate performances, while Q2 would not, due to the `DISTINCT` keyword.\n\nSince the `Performance_ID` is a primary key, it is not possible to have duplicate `Performance_ID` values in the `performance` table. Therefore, the use of `COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(DISTINCT performance.Performance_ID)` will yield the same result because each `Performance_ID` is guaranteed to be unique.\n\nGiven the schema constraints, there is no way to modify the example database such that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical.

It does not consider whether the student_id exists in the Highschooler table or not. It simply groups by student_id and counts the number of rows for each student_id, which represents the number of friends.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, starts with the Highschooler table and performs a LEFT JOIN with the Friend table on Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id. This means that it will include all Highschooler IDs, even if they do not have any friends (i.e., there is no corresponding student_id in the Friend table). The COUNT(Friend.friend_id) will count the number of non-null friend_id values for each Highschooler.ID, which effectively counts the number of friends for each high schooler. However, if there are Highschooler IDs with no friends, they will still be included in the result with a count of 0.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider the following example database:\n\nHighschooler table:\n| ID | name | grade |\n|----|------|-------|\n| 1  | John | 10    |\n| 2  | Jane | 11    |\n| 3  | Jake | 12    |\n\nFriend table:\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 1          | 3         |\n\nFor Q1, the output will be:\n| student_id | count(*) |\n|------------|----------|\n| 1          | 2        |\n\nFor Q2, the output will be:\n| ID | COUNT(Friend.friend_id) |\n|----|-------------------------|\n| 1  | 2                       |\n| 2  | 0                       |\n| 3  | 0                       |\n\nAs you can see, Q2 includes all high schoolers, even those without friends, and assigns them a count of 0, while Q1 only includes those with friends and counts the number of friends they have.\n\nTo create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, we can simply add a high schooler to the Highschooler table who has no friends in the Friend table:\n\nHighschooler table (modified):\n| ID | name | grade |\n|----|------|-------|\n| 1  | John | 10    |\n| 2  | Jane | 11    |\n| 3  | Jake | 12    |\n| 4  | Jill | 9     |  <-- New high schooler with no friends\n\nFriend table (unchanged):\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 1          | 3         |\n\nNow, Q1's output remains the same, but Q2's output will include the new high schooler with a count of 0:\n\nQ2's output with the modified database:\n| ID | COUNT(Friend.friend_id) |\n|----|-------------------------|\n| 1  | 2                       |\n| 2  | 0                       |\n| 3  | 0                       |\n| 4  | 0                       |  <-- New row\n\nSince we can create a database where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT student_id ,  count(*) FROM Friend GROUP BY student_id```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Highschooler.ID, COUNT(Friend.friend_id)  FROM Highschooler  LEFT JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id  GROUP BY Highschooler.ID```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Therefore, the queries should be equivalent.\n\nTo further confirm, let's consider a counterexample.

The `NOT IN` subquery in Q2 will return unexpected results if the subquery `SELECT student_id FROM Friend` includes any NULL values. When there is a NULL value in the list of values returned by the subquery, the `NOT IN` condition will fail for all values, and the outer query will return an empty set.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this:\n\nLet's say we have the following data in the `Highschooler` table:\n\n```\nHighschooler\nID | Name  | Grade\n---|-------|------\n1  | Alice | 10\n2  | Bob   | 11\n3  | Carol | 12\n```\n\nAnd the following data in the `Friend` table:\n\n```\nFriend\nstudent_id | friend_id\n-----------|----------\n1          | 2\nNULL       | 3\n```\n\nFor Q1, the query will return the IDs from `Highschooler` that are not present in the `Friend` table as `student_id`. The result will be:\n\n```\nID\n---\n3\n```\n\nFor Q2, the query will attempt to return the IDs from `Highschooler` where the ID is not in the list of `student_id` from the `Friend` table. However, because there is a NULL value in the `student_id` column, the `NOT IN` condition will not be true for any value, and the result will be an empty set:\n\n```\nID\n---\n(empty set)\n```\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent because they can produce different results when the `Friend` table contains NULL values in the `student_id` column.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT id FROM Highschooler EXCEPT SELECT student_id FROM Friend```\n\nQ2:```SELECT ID  FROM Highschooler  WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The result of this query will be the set of IDs that are both in the `Friend` table as `student_id` and in the `Likes` table as `liked_id`.\n\nQ2 is a bit more complex. It joins the `Highschooler` table with the `Friend` table on `Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id`, then joins the result with the `Likes` table on `Highschooler.ID = Likes.student_id`. It then filters the result to include only those `Highschooler.ID` that are also present as `friend_id` in the `Friend` table. Finally, it groups the results by `Highschooler.ID`.\n\nAt first glance, it seems that Q2 is doing more work than Q1, but let's consider the actual logic. Q2 is effectively finding all `Highschooler.ID` that are friends with someone (since they appear as `student_id` in the `Friend` table) and have liked someone (since they appear as `student_id` in the `Likes` table). The additional `WHERE` clause and `GROUP BY` seem to be redundant because the join conditions already ensure that the `Highschooler.ID` is in the `Friend` table as both `student_id` and `friend_id`.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle difference. Q2 includes an additional condition that the `Highschooler.ID` must also be in the `Friend` table as `friend_id`. This means that Q2 could potentially exclude some IDs that are present in the `Friend` table only as `student_id` and not as `friend_id`, but are present in the `Likes` table as `student_id`.\n\nTo see if this difference can lead to non-equivalent results, let's construct a counterexample:\n\nSuppose we have the following data:\n\nHighschooler:\n| ID | Name | Grade |\n|----|------|-------|\n| 1  | John | 10    |\n| 2  | Jane | 11    |\n| 3  | Jim  | 12    |\n\nFriend:\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 2          | 1         |\n| 3          | 1         |\n\nLikes:\n| student_id | liked_id |\n|------------|----------|\n| 1          | 2        |\n| 3          | 1        |\n\nFor Q1, the result would be:\n| student_id |\n|------------|\n| 1          |\n\nFor Q2, the result would be empty because there is no `Highschooler.ID` that is both a `student_id` and a `friend_id` in the `Friend` table and also a `student_id` in the `Likes` table.\n\nSince we have found a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the answer is:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT student_id FROM Friend INTERSECT SELECT liked_id FROM Likes```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Highschooler.ID FROM Highschooler INNER JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.student_id INNER JOIN Likes ON Highschooler.ID = Likes.student_id WHERE Highschooler.ID IN (   SELECT friend_id   FROM Friend ) GROUP BY Highschooler.ID```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It does this by using subqueries in the `WHERE` clause to check for the existence of the student's ID in both the `Friend` and `Likes` tables.\n\nAt first glance, the queries seem to be equivalent because they both aim to find students who are both friends and liked by others. However, there is a subtle difference in the conditions they are checking.\n\nQ1 checks for students who are friends (`T1.student_id`) and who are liked (`T1.liked_id`), while Q2 checks for students who are friends (`Friend.student_id`) and who like others (`Likes.student_id`).\n\nThis difference means that Q1 is looking for students who are the target of both friendship and affection, while Q2 is looking for students who are friends to others and also like others.

The `HAVING` clause ensures that only students with two or more likes are included in the result set.\n\nSince the aliases used in Q1 do not change the logic of the query and the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are functionally identical in both queries, the queries are semantically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.name FROM Likes AS T1 JOIN Highschooler AS T2 ON T1.student_id  =  T2.id GROUP BY T1.student_id HAVING count(*)  >=  2```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Highschooler.name FROM Highschooler JOIN Likes ON Highschooler.ID = Likes.student_id GROUP BY Highschooler.ID HAVING COUNT(Likes.liked_id) >= 2;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, there is a subtle difference in how they are filtering the Highschooler table.\n\nLet's consider a counterexample to see if the outputs can be different:\n\nImagine a Highschooler table with the following data:\n\n| ID | name | grade |\n|----|------|-------|\n| 1  | John | 90    |\n| 2  | Jane | 80    |\n| 3  | Jake | 70    |\n\nAnd a Friend table with the following data:\n\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 2          | 1         |\n| 3          | 1         |\n\nFor Q1, the subquery would return student IDs 1, 2, and 3, because they all appear in the Friend table as student_ids. Therefore, no rows from the Highschooler table would satisfy the WHERE condition, and the result of Q1 would be NULL (since there are no grades to take the minimum of).\n\nFor Q2, the subquery would also return student IDs 1, 2, and 3. Again, no rows from the Highschooler table would satisfy the WHERE condition, and the result of Q2 would be NULL.\n\nIn this case, both queries return the same result. However, let's modify the Friend table to create a counterexample:\n\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 2          | 1         |\n\nNow, student ID 3 does not appear in the Friend table as a student_id. For Q1, the subquery would return student IDs 1 and 2, so the minimum grade would be taken from the remaining highschooler, which is Jake with a grade of 70.\n\nFor Q2, the subquery would also return student IDs 1 and 2, and the minimum grade would be taken from the remaining highschooler, which is Jake with a grade of 70.\n\nEven with this modification, both queries still return the same result. To find a counterexample, we need to create a situation where the JOIN in Q1 makes a difference.\n\nLet's modify the Friend table once more:\n\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 2          | 3         |\n\nNow, for Q1, the JOIN operation will include student ID 2 in the result of the subquery because it is joined with the Highschooler table. The subquery will return student IDs 1 and 2, and the minimum grade would be taken from the remaining highschooler, which is Jake with a grade of 70.\n\nFor Q2, the subquery will only return student ID 1 because it is the only student_id in the Friend table without considering the friend_id. Therefore, the minimum grade would be taken from the remaining highschoolers, which are Jane and Jake, with the lowest grade being Jake's 70.\n\nIn this case, both queries still return the same result, which is the grade of 70. It seems that no matter how we modify the Friend table, as long as the Highschooler table remains the same, both queries will return the same result because they are both looking for highschoolers who are not friends with anyone.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis and the attempts to find a counterexample, we can conclude that:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT min(grade) FROM Highschooler WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT T1.student_id FROM Friend AS T1 JOIN Highschooler AS T2 ON T1.student_id  =  T2.id)```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Highschooler.grade FROM Highschooler WHERE Highschooler.ID NOT IN      (SELECT Friend.student_id      FROM Friend) ORDER BY Highschooler.grade ASC LIMIT 1;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Here's the counterexample:\n\nLet's say we have the following data:\n\nProfessionals:\n| professional_id | first_name | ... |\n|-----------------|------------|-----|\n| 1               | Alice      | ... |\n| 2               | Bob        | ... |\n\nOwners:\n| owner_id | first_name | ... |\n|----------|------------|-----|\n| 1        | Alice      | ... |\n| 2        | Charlie    | ... |\n\nDogs:\n| dog_id | name   | ... |\n|--------|--------|-----|\n| 1      | Daisy  | ... |\n| 2      | Bob    | ... |\n\nNow let's look at the output of both queries:\n\nQ1: SELECT first_name FROM Professionals UNION SELECT first_name FROM Owners EXCEPT SELECT name FROM Dogs\nThis query will first combine all `first_name` from `Professionals` and `Owners`, and then exclude any `name` that appears in `Dogs`. The result will be:\n- Alice (from both Professionals and Owners, but not excluded because it's not in Dogs)\n- Charlie (from Owners, not in Dogs)\n\nQ2: SELECT first_name FROM Owners WHERE first_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM Dogs) UNION SELECT first_name FROM Professionals WHERE first_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM Dogs)\nThis query will select `first_name` from `Owners` where the `first_name` is not in `Dogs`, and then union that with `first_name` from `Professionals` where the `first_name` is not in `Dogs`. The result will be:\n- Alice (from Owners, not in Dogs)\n- Charlie (from Owners, not in Dogs)\n- Alice (from Professionals, not in Dogs)\n\nAs we can see, in Q2, Alice appears twice in the result set before the UNION operation because she is in both `Professionals` and `Owners` and not in `Dogs`. However, UNION will remove duplicates, so the final result will still be Alice and Charlie, just like in Q1.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like the results are the same, but there's a subtle difference in how duplicates are handled in the two queries. The key point is that UNION removes duplicates after combining the results of the two SELECT statements, while EXCEPT removes all occurrences of the duplicates from the result set.\n\nIf we modify the example database such that `first_name` in `Professionals` or `Owners` is NULL and there is a corresponding NULL in `Dogs`, the two queries will produce different results because the semantics of NULL comparison are different in the two queries.\n\nFor example, if we have:\n\nProfessionals:\n| professional_id | first_name | ... |\n|-----------------|------------|-----|\n| 1               | NULL       | ... |\n\nOwners:\n| owner_id | first_name | ... |\n|----------|------------|-----|\n| 1        | NULL       | ... |\n\nDogs:\n| dog_id | name   | ... |\n|--------|--------|-----|\n| 1      | NULL   | ... |\n\nQ1 will not include NULL in the result set because NULL is not considered equal to NULL in SQL, so the EXCEPT clause will not exclude NULL from the result set.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will not include NULL in the result set because the NOT IN subquery will return unknown for any comparison with NULL, and thus the WHERE clause will not be true for rows with NULL `first_name`.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT first_name FROM Professionals UNION SELECT first_name FROM Owners EXCEPT SELECT name FROM Dogs```\n\nQ2:```SELECT first_name   FROM Owners   WHERE first_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM Dogs)   UNION   SELECT first_name   FROM Professionals   WHERE first_name NOT IN (SELECT name FROM Dogs)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It groups by `breed_code` and orders by the count in ascending order, taking the first result with the smallest count.\n\nQ2: The subquery attempts to select the `breed_name` based on the count, but it is missing a GROUP BY clause, which is necessary to use COUNT(*) in an ORDER BY clause. As written, this query is invalid because it uses an aggregate function without a GROUP BY clause.

This means that Q1 will return a distinct list of property type descriptions that exist in the `Properties` table, without duplicates.\n\nQ2 selects the property type description from the `Properties` table for a specific `property_type_code` provided in the WHERE clause. This means that Q2 will return the property type description only for the specified `property_type_code`.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, let's consider an example database:\n\nRef_Property_Types:\n| property_type_code | property_type_description |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1                  | Apartment                 |\n| 2                  | House                     |\n| 3                  | Office                    |\n\nProperties:\n| property_id | property_type_code | ... |\n|-------------|--------------------|-----|\n| 101         | 1                  | ... |\n| 102         | 1                  | ... |\n| 103         | 2                  | ... |\n\nFor Q1, the result would be:\n| property_type_description |\n|---------------------------|\n| Apartment                 |\n| House                     |\n\nFor Q2, assuming we insert the code '1' where it says \"[insert code here]\", the result would be:\n| property_type_description |\n|---------------------------|\n| Apartment                 |\n\nAs you can see, Q1 returns all distinct property type descriptions present in the `Properties` table, while Q2 returns the description for a single property type code. If we modify the database such that there are multiple property types in the `Properties` table, Q1 will return all of them (without duplicates), while Q2 will always return only the description for the specified code.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.property_type_description FROM Properties AS T1 JOIN Ref_Property_Types AS T2 ON T1.property_type_code  =  T2.property_type_code GROUP BY T1.property_type_code```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Properties.property_type_description FROM Properties JOIN Ref_Property_Types ON Properties.property_type_code = Ref_Property_Types.property_type_code WHERE Properties.property_type_code = [insert code here]```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

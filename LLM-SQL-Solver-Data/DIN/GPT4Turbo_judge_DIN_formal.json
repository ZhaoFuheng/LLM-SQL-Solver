This subquery will return the `stadium_id` with the most concerts since 2014.

It will then select the name and capacity of the stadium with that stadium_id.\n\nIn our example, both StadiumA and StadiumB have the same number of concerts (2 each) after 2013.

In a well-structured database with proper referential integrity enforced by foreign keys, every `PetID` in the `Has_Pet` table should correspond to a unique pet in the `Pets` table, and thus counting `PetID` should yield the same result as counting all rows.\n\nHowever, there is a potential difference: if there are any NULL values in the `PetID` column of the `Has_Pet` table, Q1 would still count those rows, while Q2 would not count them because the COUNT function does not include NULLs when a specific column is specified.\n\nGiven the database schema provided, where `PetID` is a primary key in the `Pets` table and also a foreign key in the `Has_Pet` table, it should not be possible for `PetID` to be NULL in the `Has_Pet` table.

It does this by joining the `student` table with the `has_pet` table on the `stuid` column, grouping by `stuid`, and using a `HAVING` clause to filter for students with a count of pets greater than one.\n\nQ2 selects the first name and sex of students who have more than one pet as well, but it does this by using a subquery. The subquery selects `stuid` from the `has_pet` table, groups by `stuid`, and uses a `HAVING` clause to filter for students with a count of `PetID` greater than one. Then, the main query selects from the `student` table where the `stuid` is in the list of `stuid`s returned by the subquery.\n\nAt first glance, both queries seem to be doing the same thing. However, there is a subtle difference in how they are grouping and counting the pets. Q1 does not specify what it is counting in the `HAVING` clause (`count(*)`), while Q2 explicitly counts `PetID` (`count(PetID)`). This difference could potentially lead to different results if there are NULL values in the `PetID` column.\n\nLet's consider a counterexample where the `PetID` is NULL for some rows in the `has_pet` table:\n\n```\nStudent Table:\n+-------+-------+-------+-----+\n| StuID | LName | Fname | Sex |\n+-------+-------+-------+-----+\n|     1 | Smith | John  | M   |\n|     2 | Doe   | Jane  | F   |\n+-------+-------+-------+-----+\n\nHas_Pet Table:\n+-------+-------+\n| StuID | PetID |\n+-------+-------+\n|     1 |     1 |\n|     1 |  NULL |\n|     2 |     2 |\n|     2 |     3 |\n+-------+-------+\n```\n\nIn this case, Q1 would count the NULL `PetID` as a pet, because `count(*)` counts rows regardless of NULL values. Therefore, it would return both John and Jane as having more than one pet. However, Q2 would not count the NULL `PetID`, because `count(PetID)` only counts non-NULL values of `PetID`. As a result, Q2 would only return Jane as having more than one pet.\n\nSince we have found a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, we can conclude:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.fname ,  T1.sex FROM student AS T1 JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1.stuid  =  T2.stuid GROUP BY T1.stuid HAVING count(*)  >  1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Fname, Sex FROM Student WHERE StuID IN (SELECT StuID FROM Has_Pet GROUP BY StuID HAVING count(PetID) > 1)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In Q1, the column name is written as `horsepower` (all lowercase), while in Q2, it is written as `Horsepower` (with a capital 'H'). SQL is generally case-insensitive for keywords, but the case sensitivity for identifiers (like column names) can depend on the database system's configuration and the collation settings of the database.\n\nFor example, in MySQL, the default behavior is case-insensitive for table names and column names, but this can be changed based on the server's case sensitivity settings or the collation of the specific database or table. In contrast, PostgreSQL treats identifiers (such as column names) in a case-sensitive manner unless they are quoted.\n\nTo demonstrate the non-equivalence, consider a database system where identifiers are case-sensitive (like PostgreSQL). If the actual column name in the `cars_data` table is `Horsepower` with a capital 'H', then Q1 would result in an error because there is no column named `horsepower` (all lowercase), while Q2 would execute correctly and return the model with the lowest horsepower value.\n\nHere is an example of how the output of Q1 and Q2 can differ due to case sensitivity:\n\n1. In a case-sensitive database, create a table `cars_data` with a column named `Horsepower` (capital 'H').\n2. Insert multiple rows into `cars_data` and `car_names` with varying `Horsepower` values and corresponding `MakeId`.\n3.

Here's the modified database:\n\n```\ncountries\n+-----------+-------------+-----------+\n| CountryId | CountryName | Continent |\n+-----------+-------------+-----------+\n| 1         | USA         | 1         |\n| 2         | Japan       | 2         |\n| 3         | Japan       | 2         |\n+-----------+-------------+-----------+\n\ncar_makers\n+----+-------+----------+---------+\n| Id | Maker | FullName | Country |\n+----+-------+----------+---------+\n| 1  | A     | MakerA   | 1       |\n| 2  | B     | MakerB   | 2       |\n| 3  | C     | MakerC   | 3       |\n+----+-------+----------+---------+\n```\n\nNow, Q1 will still return 'Japan' because it groups by `CountryId` and counts the number of car makers per country ID, which will be 1 for both Japan entries.\n\nQ2, however, will group by `CountryName`, and since there are two entries for 'Japan' with different `CountryId`s, it will count them together and return 'Japan' as the country with the most car makers (2 in total).\n\nSince we have found a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.CountryName FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN COUNTRIES AS T2 ON T1.Country  =  T2.CountryId GROUP BY T1.Country ORDER BY Count(*) DESC LIMIT 1;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T2.CountryName FROM car_makers AS T1 JOIN countries AS T2 ON T1.Country = T2.CountryId GROUP BY T2.CountryName ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

They are then grouping the results by `t2.id` (or `T2.Id`), which is the primary key of the `car_makers` table.\n\nQ1 is selecting the count of all rows (*) and the `fullname` from the `car_makers` table, while Q2 is selecting the count of `Model` from the `model_list` table and the `fullname` from the `car_makers` table. Since the `model_list` table is joined with the `car_makers` table, and we are counting the number of models for each maker, the count will be the same regardless of whether we count the number of rows (*) or the number of `Model` entries, as long as there are no NULL values in the `Model` column of the `model_list` table.\n\nThe GROUP BY clause in Q2 includes both `T2.Id` and `T2.FullName`, but since `T2.Id` is the primary key and `T2.FullName` is functionally dependent on `T2.Id`, including `T2.FullName` in the GROUP BY clause does not change the result of the query. Each `T2.Id` will have exactly one `T2.FullName` associated with it, so the grouping remains effectively the same.\n\nTherefore, for all possible databases that adhere to the given schema, including any constraints like primary keys and foreign keys, the two queries will yield identical results. There is no modification to the example database that would cause the outputs of Q1 and Q2 to be different, given that the schema constraints are respected (i.e., no NULL values in the `Model` column of the `model_list` table and unique `Id` in the `car_makers` table).", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```select count(*) ,  t2.fullname from model_list as t1 join car_makers as t2 on t1.maker  =  t2.id group by t2.id;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT count(T1.Model) ,  T2.FullName FROM model_list AS T1 JOIN car_makers AS T2 ON T1.Maker  =  T2.Id GROUP BY T2.Id, T2.FullName```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The key difference between the two queries is that Q1 does not include T2.FullName in the GROUP BY clause, while Q2 does.\n\nHere's an example that will produce different results for Q1 and Q2:\n\nLet's say we have the following data in the `car_makers` table:\n\n| Id | FullName | Country |\n|----|----------|---------|\n| 1  | MakerA   | 1       |\n| 2  | MakerB   | 1       |\n\nAnd the following data in the `model_list` table:\n\n| ModelId | Maker | Model |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 1     | ModelX|\n| 2       | 1     | ModelY|\n\nNow, let's run the queries:\n\nQ1 will group only by `T2.id`, which means it will aggregate all records from `model_list` that have the same `Maker` value. Since both ModelX and ModelY have the same `Maker` (1), they will be counted together, and the `FullName` will be arbitrarily chosen from one of the grouped records (since it's not included in the GROUP BY clause, the selection of `FullName` is not guaranteed to be consistent across different SQL database systems).\n\nThe result of Q1 might look like this (depending on the SQL database system):\n\n| Count(*) | FullName | id  |\n|----------|----------|-----|\n| 2        | MakerA   | 1   |\n| 0        | MakerB   | 2   |\n\nQ2, on the other hand, groups by both `T2.Id` and `T2.FullName`, which ensures that the `FullName` is consistently associated with the correct `Id`.\n\nThe result of Q2 will look like this:\n\n| count(T1.Model) | Id | FullName |\n|-----------------|----|----------|\n| 2               | 1  | MakerA   |\n| 0               | 2  | MakerB   |\n\nIn this case, the results are the same, but if the SQL database system handling Q1 does not guarantee the selection of `FullName` without it being in the GROUP BY clause, the results could differ. Some SQL database systems might even throw an error for Q1 because `FullName` is not included in the GROUP BY clause or in an aggregate function.\n\nTherefore, since there is a possibility that the two queries could yield different results depending on the SQL database system used, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT Count(*) ,  T2.FullName ,  T2.id FROM MODEL_LIST AS T1 JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T2 ON T1.Maker  =  T2.Id GROUP BY T2.id;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT count(T1.Model), T2.Id, T2.FullName FROM model_list AS T1 JOIN car_makers AS T2 ON T1.Maker = T2.Id GROUP BY T2.Id, T2.FullName```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The `WHERE` clause in Q1 filters for `T3.CountryName = 'usa'`, while Q2 filters for `T3.CountryName = 'United States'`. Unless the database has been set up in a non-standard way where 'usa' and 'United States' are considered the same, these two conditions will filter different sets of rows, leading to potentially different counts.\n\n2.

Q2 would return a count of 0 because there are no rows with `CountryName = 'United States'` and also because it does not count rows where `T1.Model` is NULL.\n\nTherefore, since we can find a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) FROM MODEL_LIST AS T1 JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T2 ON T1.Maker  =  T2.Id JOIN COUNTRIES AS T3 ON T2.Country  =  T3.CountryId WHERE T3.CountryName  =  'usa';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT count(T1.Model) FROM model_list AS T1 JOIN car_makers AS T2 ON T1.Maker = T2.Id JOIN countries AS T3 ON T2.Country = T3.CountryId WHERE T3.CountryName = 'United States'```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Therefore, Q2 will only average the `Edispl` for `MakeId = 1` and `MakeId = 2`, which is still 2.5 in this case.\n\nTo create a discrepancy, let's also modify the `cars_data` table to include a row that corresponds to the new row in `car_names`:\n\nTable `cars_data` (modified):\n| Id | MPG | Cylinders | Edispl | Horsepower | Weight | Accelerate | Year |\n|----|-----|-----------|--------|------------|--------|------------|------|\n| 1  | 20  | 4         | 2.0    | 100        | 1500   | 10         | 2000 |\n| 2  | 25  | 6         | 3.0    | 150        | 2000   | 12         | 2001 |\n| 3  | 30  | 4         | 1.5    | 120        | 1600   | 11         | 2002 | <-- New row corresponding to `MakeId = 3`.\n\nNow, Q1 will calculate the average `Edispl` including the new row:\n- The average `Edispl` will be (2.0 + 3.0 + 1.5) / 3 = 2.166...\n\nQ2 will not include the new row because it does not have a corresponding entry in `model_list`:\n- The average `Edispl` will remain (2.0 + 3.0) / 2 = 2.5.\n\nSince the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are different with this modified example database, we can conclude that the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT avg(T2.edispl) FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId  =  T2.Id WHERE T1.Model  =  'volvo';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT avg(T1.Edispl) FROM cars_data AS T1 JOIN car_names AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.MakeId JOIN model_list AS T3 ON T2.Model = T3.Model WHERE T3.Model = 'volvo'```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Additionally, Q1 groups only by `T1.Id`, whereas Q2 groups by both `T1.Id` and `T1.Maker`.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider the following data in the `car_makers` and `model_list` tables:\n\ncar_makers:\n| Id | Maker | FullName | Country |\n|----|-------|----------|---------|\n| 1  | Ford  | Ford Motor Company | USA |\n| 2  | GM    | General Motors | USA |\n\nmodel_list:\n| ModelId | Maker | Model |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 1     | Model A |\n| 2       | 1     | Model B |\n| 3       | 1     | Model C |\n| 4       | 1     | Model D |\n| 5       | 2     | Model E |\n| 6       | 2     | Model F |\n| 7       | 2     | Model G |\n| 8       | 2     | Model H |\n\nIf we run Q1 and Q2 on this data, we will get different results because Q1 will return the `FullName` of the car maker, while Q2 will return the `Maker` (which seems to be an error in the query since `Maker` is an integer ID and not a string name).\n\nThe output of Q1 will be:\n| FullName            | Id |\n|---------------------|----|\n| Ford Motor Company  | 1  |\n| General Motors      | 2  |\n\nThe output of Q2 will be:\n| Id | Maker |\n|----|-------|\n| 1  | 1     |\n| 2  | 2     |\n\nAs you can see, the outputs are not identical because the selected columns are different.

It selects distinct `Model` from `model_list` where the `FullName` of the maker is 'General Motors' or the `Weight` in `cars_data` is greater than 3500.\n\nQ2 joins `model_list` with `car_makers` on `Maker`, then with `car_names` on `Model`, and finally with `cars_data` on `MakeId`. It selects distinct `Model` from `model_list` where the `FullName` of the maker is 'General Motors' or the `Weight` in `cars_data` is greater than 3500.\n\nThe difference between the two queries is the tables on which they join `cars_data`. Q1 joins `cars_data` on `car_names.MakeId`, while Q2 joins `cars_data` on `car_names.MakeId` as well, but the order of joins is different, which can lead to different results if there are inconsistencies in the `MakeId` and `Model` relationships.\n\nIn our example, both `Model A` and `Model B` would be selected by Q2 because `Model B` has a weight greater than 3500, regardless of its maker. However, Q1 would only select `Model A` because it requires that the `Model` in `car_names` has a `MakeId` that matches the `Id` in `cars_data`, and `Model B` does not meet the 'General Motors' condition.\n\nTherefore, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 can be different, and the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT DISTINCT T2.Model FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN MODEL_LIST AS T2 ON T1.Model  =  T2.Model JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T3 ON T2.Maker  =  T3.Id JOIN CARS_DATA AS T4 ON T1.MakeId  =  T4.Id WHERE T3.FullName  =  'General Motors' OR T4.weight  >  3500;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT DISTINCT T1.Model FROM model_list AS T1 JOIN car_makers AS T2 ON T1.Maker = T2.Id JOIN car_names AS T3 ON T1.Model = T3.Model JOIN cars_data AS T4 ON T3.MakeId = T4.Id WHERE T2.FullName = 'General Motors' OR T4.Weight > 3500```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, if we modify the `cars_data` table to have two 'volvo' cars with the same minimum acceleration value but different cylinder counts, we can see the difference.\n\nLet's modify the `cars_data` table:\n| Id | Accelerate | Cylinders |\n|----|------------|-----------|\n| 1  | 8          | 4         |\n| 2  | 8          | 6         |\n\nNow, Q1 will still return the car with the lowest acceleration value, but since there are two cars with the same acceleration value, it will return the one that comes first in the ordered list, which is determined by the `ORDER BY` clause.\n\nThe result of Q1 will now be:\n| cylinders |\n|-----------|\n| 4         |\n\nQ2, however, will return the cylinders for all 'volvo' models with the minimum acceleration value, which is 8.

The `model_list` table includes both models linked to the maker Volvo.\n\nNow, let's examine the queries:\n\nQ1 is looking for the Volvo model directly in the `car_names` table and then joining with `cars_data` to get the `Cylinders`. It will return the `Cylinders` value for the model with the lowest `Accelerate` value.\n\nQ2 is looking for the maker Volvo in the `car_makers` table, then joining with `model_list` to get all models made by Volvo, then joining with `car_names` to get the corresponding `MakeId`, and finally joining with `cars_data` to get the `Cylinders`. It will also return the `Cylinders` value for the model with the lowest `Accelerate` value.\n\nThe difference arises because Q1 directly filters on the `Model` column in the `car_names` table, while Q2 uses a join with `model_list` to determine the models made by Volvo. If there is a discrepancy between the `Model` values in `car_names` and `model_list`, or if there are models in `car_names` that do not have corresponding entries in `cars_data`, the results of the two queries could differ.\n\nIn the example database provided, if the `Model` 'volvo' in Q1 does not match any `Model` in the `model_list` that is linked to the maker Volvo, or if there is a typo or inconsistency in the model names, Q1 and Q2 would yield different results. Additionally, if there are Volvo models in `car_names` that are not present in `model_list`, Q2 would not consider them, while Q1 would.\n\nTherefore, since there is a possibility of constructing a database where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.cylinders FROM CARS_DATA AS T1 JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T2 ON T1.Id  =  T2.MakeId WHERE T2.Model  =  'volvo' ORDER BY T1.accelerate ASC LIMIT 1;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T4.Cylinders FROM car_makers AS T1 JOIN model_list AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.Maker JOIN car_names AS T3 ON T2.Model = T3.Model JOIN cars_data AS T4 ON T3.MakeId = T4.Id WHERE T1.Maker = 'Volvo' ORDER BY T4.Accelerate ASC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Q1 compares 'Accelerate' with another 'Accelerate' value, while Q2 compares 'Accelerate' with a 'Horsepower' value.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider the following data in the 'cars_data' table:\n\n| Id | MPG | Cylinders | Edispl | Horsepower | Weight | Accelerate | Year |\n|----|-----|-----------|--------|------------|--------|------------|------|\n| 1  | 30  | 4         | 1.6    | 100        | 2000   | 12         | 1980 |\n| 2  | 25  | 6         | 2.4    | 150        | 2500   | 10         | 1985 |\n| 3  | 20  | 8         | 3.2    | 200        | 3000   | 15         | 1990 |\n\nFor Q1, the subquery `(SELECT Accelerate FROM CARS_DATA ORDER BY Horsepower DESC LIMIT 1)` will return 15 because it's the 'Accelerate' value of the car with the highest 'Horsepower' (200). The main query will then count how many cars have an 'Accelerate' value greater than 15, which is 0.\n\nFor Q2, the subquery `(SELECT max(Horsepower) FROM cars_data)` will return 200 because it's the maximum 'Horsepower' in the table. The main query will then count how many cars have an 'Accelerate' value greater than 200, which is also 0.\n\nHowever, if we modify the 'cars_data' table as follows:\n\n| Id | MPG | Cylinders | Edispl | Horsepower | Weight | Accelerate | Year |\n|----|-----|-----------|--------|------------|--------|------------|------|\n| 1  | 30  | 4         | 1.6    | 100        | 2000   | 210        | 1980 |\n| 2  | 25  | 6         | 2.4    | 150        | 2500   | 10         | 1985 |\n| 3  | 20  | 8         | 3.2    | 200        | 3000   | 15         | 1990 |\n\nFor Q1, the subquery will still return 15, and the main query will count how many cars have an 'Accelerate' value greater than 15, which is now 1 (the car with 'Accelerate' = 210).\n\nFor Q2, the subquery will still return 200, and the main query will count how many cars have an 'Accelerate' value greater than 200, which is 1 (the same car with 'Accelerate' = 210).\n\nAlthough in this modified example the counts are the same, the reason for the counts is different, and it is possible to create a scenario where the counts would differ.

This car will not be selected by either query due to the `Horsepower > (SELECT MIN(Horsepower) FROM cars_data)` condition. However, if there is another car with the same `MakeId` as the car with the minimum horsepower but with 3 or fewer cylinders and more horsepower than the minimum, it will be selected by Q2 but not by Q1.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nLet's say we have the following data:\n\ncar_names:\n| MakeId | Model | Make   |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| 1      | A     | Maker1 |\n| 2      | B     | Maker2 |\n\ncars_data:\n| Id | MPG | Cylinders | Edispl | Horsepower | Weight | Accelerate | Year |\n|----|-----|-----------|--------|------------|--------|------------|------|\n| 1  | 30  | 4         | 1.6    | 100        | 2000   | 10         | 2000 |\n| 2  | 35  | 3         | 1.2    | 110        | 1500   | 12         | 2001 |\n\nIn this case, the car with `Id` 1 has the minimum horsepower of 100, but it has 4 cylinders, so it doesn't meet the `Cylinders <= 3` condition. The car with `Id` 2 has more horsepower than the minimum and has 3 or fewer cylinders, so it meets both conditions.\n\nQ1 will not return any rows because it's looking for cars in `CARS_DATA` with a `MakeId` that matches the `Id` of a car with more than the minimum horsepower and 3 or fewer cylinders.

Q1 uses an INNER JOIN, which will only return rows where there is at least one match in both tables.

The difference between the two queries is in how they check for the absence of the airport code in the flights table.\n\nQ1 uses a UNION to combine the results of two subqueries (one for SourceAirport and one for DestAirport) and then checks if the AirportCode is not present in the combined list.\n\nQ2 checks for the absence of the AirportCode separately in each subquery (one for SourceAirport and one for DestAirport) using two NOT IN conditions combined with an AND operator.\n\nThe UNION operator in SQL removes duplicates from the result set. Therefore, if an AirportCode appears in both the SourceAirport and DestAirport columns, it will only appear once in the result of the UNION. This means that Q1 will exclude an airport if its code is present in either column.\n\nQ2 achieves the same result by using two separate NOT IN conditions. An airport will be excluded if its code is not in the SourceAirport list AND it is not in the DestAirport list. This means that if an AirportCode is present in either the SourceAirport or the DestAirport column, it will be excluded from the result.\n\nSince both queries effectively exclude airports that are present in either the SourceAirport or DestAirport columns, they are semantically equivalent.

Since Alice and Bob both have the highest number of evaluations (2 each), the query will return the name of the employee with the highest Employee_ID among those with the highest count, which is Bob (assuming Employee_ID is ordered and Bob has a higher ID than Alice).\n\nQ2 will group by `T1.Name` and use a subquery to find the maximum count of evaluations. Since Alice and Bob both have the maximum count of evaluations (2), the query will return the names of all employees with the maximum count of evaluations. However, since SQL does not guarantee the order of results without an ORDER BY clause, the query could return either Alice or Bob, or both if the SQL engine supports returning multiple rows for a single HAVING condition.\n\nTo make the outputs different, we can ensure that Alice and Bob have the same maximum number of evaluations, but we assign them different Employee_IDs such that one has a higher ID than the other. This way, Q1 will return only one name (the one with the higher Employee_ID), while Q2 could return both names.\n\nFor example, if we assign Employee_ID 1 to Alice and Employee_ID 2 to Bob, Q1 will return \"Bob\" because he has the higher Employee_ID, while Q2 could return both \"Alice\" and \"Bob\" because they both have the maximum count of evaluations.

It does this by joining the hiring and shop tables, grouping by shop_id, and ordering by the count of employees in descending order. It then limits the results to the top one, which means it will return the shop with the most employees.\n\nQ2 attempts to do something similar but includes an additional GROUP BY clause for T2.Name and uses a HAVING clause to filter the results to only those shops where the count of employees equals the maximum count of employees hired at any shop. This subquery calculates the maximum number of employees hired at any shop.\n\nThe difference lies in the fact that Q1 will return the first shop with the highest number of employees in case of a tie (due to the LIMIT 1 clause), while Q2 will return all shops that share the maximum number of employees hired. If there is a tie for the highest number of employees between multiple shops, Q1 will return only one of those shops (the one that appears first in the result set), whereas Q2 will return all shops that have that maximum number of employees.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider the following data:\n\nshop:\n| Shop_ID | Name   |\n|---------|--------|\n| 1       | ShopA  |\n| 2       | ShopB  |\n\nhiring:\n| Shop_ID | Employee_ID |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 1       | E1          |\n| 1       | E2          |\n| 2       | E3          |\n| 2       | E4          |\n\nBoth shops have the same number of employees (2 each). Q1 will return either \"ShopA\" or \"ShopB\" depending on which one comes first in the ordered result set.

Since there are two documents for `template_id` 1 and one document for `template_id` 2, the query will return the row with `template_id` 1.\n\nQ2 will join Templates with Documents on `Template_ID`, group by both `Template_ID` and `Template_Type_Code`, and order by the count of documents for each template in descending order. Since there are two documents for `Template_ID` 1 and one document for `Template_ID` 2, the query will return the row with `Template_ID` 1.\n\nAt first glance, it seems that both queries will return the same result for this example. However, the difference lies in the fact that Q1 does not include `Template_Type_Code` in the GROUP BY clause, while Q2 does.\n\nNow, let's modify the example database to create a counterexample:\n\n```\nTemplates Table:\n+------------+----------------+------------------+\n| Template_ID| Version_Number | Template_Type_Code|\n+------------+----------------+------------------+\n|          1 |              1 |                A |\n|          1 |              2 |                B |\n+------------+----------------+------------------+\n\nDocuments Table:\n+-------------+------------+-------------------+\n| Document_ID | Template_ID| Document_Name     |\n+-------------+------------+-------------------+\n|           1 |          1 | Document1         |\n|           2 |          1 | Document2         |\n+-------------+------------+-------------------+\n```\n\nIn this modified example, `Template_ID` 1 has two different `Template_Type_Code` values (A and B). When we run Q1, it will still return a single row with `template_id` 1, but it will arbitrarily pick one of the `Template_Type_Code` values (since it's not included in the GROUP BY clause). On the other hand, Q2 will return an error because the GROUP BY clause includes both `Template_ID` and `Template_Type_Code`, and there are two different `Template_Type_Code` values for the same `Template_ID`.\n\nThis demonstrates that the two queries are not equivalent because they can produce different results under certain conditions.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.template_id ,  T2.Template_Type_Code FROM Documents AS T1 JOIN Templates AS T2 ON T1.template_id  =  T2.template_id GROUP BY T1.template_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Template_ID, T1.Template_Type_Code FROM Templates AS T1 JOIN Documents AS T2 ON T1.Template_ID = T2.Template_ID GROUP BY T1.Template_ID, T1.Template_Type_Code ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The only difference between the two queries is the case of the letters in the column name `Template_Type_Code`. SQL is generally case-insensitive for column names, unless the database system is explicitly configured to treat identifiers as case-sensitive or the identifiers are quoted in a case-sensitive manner.\n\nGiven that the database schema provided does not indicate that the identifiers are case-sensitive or quoted in a way that enforces case sensitivity, we can assume that the column names are treated in a case-insensitive manner. Therefore, `template_type_code` and `Template_Type_Code` are considered equivalent identifiers in this context.\n\nSince the queries are identical in their logic and the case of the column names does not affect the result, the queries will yield identical results for all possible databases that adhere to the given schema. Thus, there is no counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 would not be identical based on the case of the column names alone.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT template_type_code FROM Templates GROUP BY template_type_code ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Template_Type_Code FROM Templates GROUP BY Template_Type_Code ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Since both tables have one entry for each template type, the result will be the same as Q1 in terms of count. However, if the SQL engine processes the JOIN in such a way that it gives a consistent ordering based on the joined table's order, it might consistently return 'A' or 'B' based on the internal ordering of the joined result set.\n\nTo create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, we can add another entry to the Templates table for one of the template types:\n\nTemplates (modified):\n| Template_ID | Version_Number | Template_Type_Code | Date_Effective_From | Date_Effective_To | Template_Details |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1           | 1              | A                  | 2023-01-01          | NULL              | Details A1       |\n| 2           | 1              | B                  | 2023-01-02          | NULL              | Details B1       |\n| 3           | 2              | A                  | 2023-01-03          | NULL              | Details A2       |\n\nNow, Q1 will return 'A' because it has the highest count of 2.\n\nQ2 will also return 'A', but for a different reason: it joins the Templates table with the Ref_Template_Types table, and since there are two entries for 'A' in the Templates table, 'A' will have a count of 2, which is higher than 'B'.\n\nHowever, if the Ref_Template_Types table does not have an entry for a Template_Type_Code that exists in the Templates table, the results could differ. For example, if the Ref_Template_Types table was missing the entry for 'B', Q1 would still count the templates of type 'B', but Q2 would not include them in the result set because the JOIN would filter them out.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not guaranteed to be equivalent for all possible databases.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT template_type_code FROM Templates GROUP BY template_type_code ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Template_Type_Code FROM Ref_Template_Types AS T1 JOIN Templates AS T2 ON T1.Template_Type_Code  =  T2.Template_Type_Code GROUP BY T1.Template_Type_Code ORDER BY count(T2.Template_ID) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It does not include `document_name` in the GROUP BY clause, which is not standard SQL and may not work in all SQL databases, but some databases like MySQL allow this with the assumption that `document_name` is functionally dependent on `document_id`.\n\nQ2 selects the `Document_ID` and `Document_Name` from the joined tables, groups by both `Document_ID` and `Document_Name`, and orders by the count of `Paragraph_ID` in descending order, limiting the result to one row.\n\nThe difference between the two queries is that Q1 does not explicitly group by `document_name`, while Q2 does. This can lead to different results if there are multiple `document_name` values for the same `document_id`, which should not happen if `document_id` is a primary key. However, if the SQL engine does not enforce functional dependency or if there is a mistake in the data, the results could differ.\n\nFor the given example database, both queries will return the same result because there is a functional dependency between `document_id` and `document_name` (each `document_id` corresponds to exactly one `document_name`). However, if there were a database with a mistake like the following:\n\n```\nDocuments Table (with a mistake):\n+-------------+------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------+\n| Document_ID | Template_ID | Document_Name | Document_Description | Other_Details |\n+-------------+------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------+\n|           1 |          1 | Doc A         | Description A       | Details A     |\n|           1 |          1 | Doc A (Typo)  | Description A       | Details A     |\n+-------------+------------+---------------+---------------------+---------------+\n```\n\nThen Q1 might return a different result than Q2 because Q1 does not group by `document_name`, and the SQL engine might not enforce the functional dependency, leading to an ambiguous result.

Since `T1.document_id` and `T2.document_id` are joined, it will select the `document_id` with the highest paragraph count and its corresponding `document_name` from the Documents table.\n\nQ2 will group by both `T1.Document_ID` and `T1.Document_Name`. Since SQL standards require that all selected columns in a GROUP BY query must be either aggregated or appear in the GROUP BY clause, this query is actually valid and will produce the same grouping as Q1. However, the inclusion of `T1.Document_Name` in the GROUP BY clause is unnecessary because `Document_ID` is unique and therefore implicitly groups `Document_Name`.\n\nIn the example database, both Q1 and Q2 will return the same result because there is a one-to-one relationship between `Document_ID` and `Document_Name`. However, if the database allowed for the possibility of a document having multiple names (which would violate normalization rules but is not explicitly prevented by the schema provided), then the queries could produce different results.\n\nFor example, if the Documents table had the following rows:\n\n```\n+-------------+------------+---------------+----------------------+\n| Document_ID | Template_ID | Document_Name | Document_Description |\n+-------------+------------+---------------+----------------------+\n|           1 |          1 | Doc1          | Description1         |\n|           1 |          1 | Doc1_Alt      | Description1         |\n+-------------+------------+---------------+----------------------+\n```\n\nThen Q1 would still return a single row with the `document_id` and one of the `document_name` values (depending on the SQL engine's handling of non-aggregated columns in a GROUP BY clause), while Q2 would return an error because of the ambiguity introduced by having multiple names for the same `document_id`.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent because there exists a possible database configuration where they could yield different results.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.document_id ,  T2.document_name FROM Paragraphs AS T1 JOIN Documents AS T2 ON T1.document_id  =  T2.document_id GROUP BY T1.document_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Document_ID, T1.Document_Name FROM Documents AS T1 JOIN Paragraphs AS T2 ON T1.Document_ID = T2.Document_ID GROUP BY T1.Document_ID, T1.Document_Name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, since Document 2 has no paragraphs, it will not be included in the join, and the result will be Document 1.\n\nThe difference between the two queries is that Q1 counts paragraphs for each document and includes documents with zero paragraphs in the result, while Q2 only includes documents that have at least one paragraph due to the inner join.

If such a case exists, Q1 would group those entries together (since it groups by `Name` only), while Q2 would not (since it groups by both `Teacher_ID` and `Name`).\n\nLet's create an example database where a teacher has two different `Teacher_ID`s but the same `Name`:\n\n```\nteacher\n+------------+------+-----+----------+\n| Teacher_ID | Name | Age | Hometown |\n+------------+------+-----+----------+\n|          1 | John |  30 | TownA    |\n|          2 | John |  40 | TownB    |\n+------------+------+-----+----------+\n\ncourse_arrange\n+-----------+------------+-------+\n| Course_ID | Teacher_ID | Grade |\n+-----------+------------+-------+\n|       101 |          1 |     A |\n|       102 |          1 |     B |\n|       103 |          2 |     A |\n+-----------+------------+-------+\n```\n\nIn this case, Q1 would return \"John\" once because it groups by `Name` and sees two entries for \"John\". However, Q2 would not return any rows because it groups by both `Teacher_ID` and `Name`, and neither teacher with ID 1 nor ID 2 has two or more courses.\n\nSince we have found a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, we can conclude that:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.Name FROM course_arrange AS T1 JOIN teacher AS T2 ON T1.Teacher_ID  =  T2.Teacher_ID GROUP BY T2.Name HAVING COUNT(*)  >=  2```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Name FROM teacher AS T1 JOIN course_arrange AS T2 ON T1.Teacher_ID  =  T2.Teacher_ID GROUP BY T1.Teacher_ID, T1.Name HAVING count(*)  >=  2```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Q2 will only return visitors who have visited the same museum more than once.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, let's consider the following data:\n\nvisitor table:\n| ID | Name | Level_of_membership | Age |\n|----|------|---------------------|-----|\n| 1  | John | Gold                | 30  |\n| 2  | Jane | Silver              | 25  |\n\nvisit table:\n| Museum_ID | visitor_ID | Num_of_Ticket | Total_spent |\n|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------|\n| 1         | 1          | 2             | 40          |\n| 2         | 1          | 1             | 20          |\n| 1         | 2          | 3             | 60          |\n| 1         | 2          | 2             | 40          |\n\nFor this data, Q1 would return both John and Jane because they both have more than one entry in the visit table. However, Q2 would only return Jane because she is the only one who has visited the same museum (Museum_ID 1) more than once.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the two queries are not equivalent, and the answer is:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT t1.id ,  t1.name ,  t1.age FROM visitor AS t1 JOIN visit AS t2 ON t1.id  =  t2.visitor_id GROUP BY t1.id HAVING count(*)  >  1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.ID, T1.Name, T1.Age FROM visitor AS T1 WHERE T1.ID IN (SELECT visitor_ID FROM visit GROUP BY visitor_ID, Museum_ID HAVING count(*) > 1)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Therefore, the `DISTINCT` keyword would have no effect, and the output of Q1 and Q2 would be identical for all possible databases.\n\nEven if the `name` column is not unique and could potentially contain duplicates, the combination of conditions in the `WHERE` clause (specific commanders for a battle) would likely result in a unique set of battle names, unless there were multiple records of the same battle with the same commanders, which would be unusual for a well-normalized database schema representing historical battles.\n\nSince the schema does not explicitly state that the `name` column is unique, let's consider the possibility of duplicates:\n\n1.

In such a case, the first query (Q1) would not include that department in the results because there is an implicit INNER JOIN due to the JOIN keyword, which only includes records with matching department_id in both tables. However, the second query (Q2) explicitly counts the number of degree_program_id, which would include departments with zero degree programs, and the result would be different.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate this:\n\nLet's say we have the following data:\n\nDepartments table:\n| department_id | department_name |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| 1             | Engineering     |\n| 2             | Humanities      |\n\nDegree_Programs table:\n| degree_program_id | department_id | degree_summary_name |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| 1                 | 1             | Mechanical Eng      |\n| 2                 | 1             | Electrical Eng      |\n\nFor Q1, the JOIN will result in:\n| department_name | department_id |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| Engineering     | 1             |\n\nAnd the GROUP BY and ORDER BY will give us the department with the most degree programs, which is 'Engineering'.\n\nFor Q2, the JOIN will result in:\n| department_name | department_id | num_degrees |\n|-----------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Engineering     | 1             | 2           |\n| Humanities      | 2             | 0           |\n\nAnd the GROUP BY and ORDER BY will still give us 'Engineering' as the department with the most degree programs.\n\nHowever, if we add a new department with no degree programs:\n\nDepartments table:\n| department_id | department_name |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| 1             | Engineering     |\n| 2             | Humanities      |\n| 3             | Science         |\n\nDegree_Programs table (unchanged):\n| degree_program_id | department_id | degree_summary_name |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| 1                 | 1             | Mechanical Eng      |\n| 2                 | 1             | Electrical Eng      |\n\nNow, Q1 will still give us 'Engineering' as the result because 'Science' has no matching rows in Degree_Programs and thus is not included in the JOIN.\n\nBut Q2 will include 'Science' with a count of 0 for num_degrees. Depending on the database's handling of sorting NULLs or zeroes, 'Science' could appear in the results if the database sorts NULLs or zeroes last.

Since both Engineering and Humanities have degree programs, it will count them and return the department with the most degree programs. In this case, it will return:\n\n| department_name | department_id |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| Engineering     | 1             |\n\nQ2 will do something similar but will also include `T1.department_name` in the GROUP BY clause. This should not change the result since `department_id` is unique and thus implicitly groups `department_name`. Q2 will return:\n\n| department_id | department_name | num_degrees |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| 1             | Engineering     | 2           |\n\nBoth queries return the department with the most degree programs, which is Engineering in this case. However, the output columns are different. Q1 returns `department_name, department_id`, while Q2 returns `department_id, department_name, num_degrees`.\n\nTo create a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, we can modify the database such that there is a department with no degree programs. Let's add a new department:\n\nDepartments:\n| department_id | department_name |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| 1             | Engineering     |\n| 2             | Humanities      |\n| 3             | Science         |\n\nAnd we do not add any degree programs for the Science department.\n\nNow, when we run Q1 and Q2, both will still return the Engineering department as it has the most degree programs. However, the presence of a department without any degree programs does not affect the result because both queries are looking for the department with the most degree programs, and the Science department has none.\n\nThe key difference between the two queries is not in how they handle departments with zero degree programs, but in the columns they return.

However, since the course_name is functionally dependent on the course_id (assuming course_id is a unique identifier for courses), grouping by course_id implicitly groups by course_name as well. This means that every unique course_id will have a unique course_name, and thus the additional group by clause in Q2 does not change the result set.\n\nIn SQL, when you have a functional dependency such that one column (course_id) uniquely determines another column (course_name), you can group by the determinant column (course_id) and still select the dependent column (course_name) without including it in the GROUP BY clause, provided that the SQL mode allows for it or the database follows the SQL standard that permits such a selection.\n\nTherefore, for all possible databases that adhere to the schema provided, the output of Q1 and Q2 will be identical, and thus the two queries are semantically equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.course_name ,  T1.course_id FROM Courses AS T1 JOIN Sections AS T2 ON T1.course_id  =  T2.course_id GROUP BY T1.course_id HAVING count(*)  <=  2```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.course_id, T1.course_name FROM Courses AS T1 JOIN Sections AS T2 ON T1.course_id = T2.course_id GROUP BY T1.course_id, T1.course_name HAVING count(*) <= 2```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Here's an example:\n\nLet's say we have a `Semesters` table with two entries:\n\n```\nSemesters\nsemester_id | semester_name\n------------|--------------\n1           | Fall 2020\n2           | Spring 2021\n```\n\nAnd a `Student_Enrolment` table with the following entries:\n\n```\nStudent_Enrolment\nstudent_enrolment_id | degree_program_id | semester_id | student_id\n---------------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------\n1                    | 1                 | 1           | 1\n2                    | 1                 | 1           | 2\n3                    | 1                 | 2           | 1\n```\n\nIn this case, both semesters have the same number of students enrolled (1 student in Spring 2021 and 2 students in Fall 2020, but one student is enrolled in both semesters).\n\nNow, let's look at the output of both queries:\n\nQ1 would group by `semester_id` and order by the count of student enrolments in descending order, then limit the result to 1. Since both semesters have the same number of distinct students, the `ORDER BY count(*) DESC` clause would not guarantee which semester comes first if the counts are equal. The result could be either semester, depending on how the SQL engine resolves this tie.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, explicitly includes `T2.semester_name` in the `GROUP BY` clause, which should not affect the count since `semester_name` is functionally dependent on `semester_id`. However, the presence of `T2.semester_name` in the `SELECT` clause and the alias `student_count` for the count might lead to a different tie-breaking behavior in some SQL engines or versions.\n\nIf the SQL engine uses the order of the columns in the `SELECT` clause as a tiebreaker, Q2 might consistently return the semester with the lowest `semester_id` or the first in alphabetical order of `semester_name` when there's a tie in `student_count`.\n\nTherefore, since there's a possibility that the two queries could yield different results due to tie-breaking behavior, they are not guaranteed to be equivalent for all possible databases.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.semester_name ,  T1.semester_id FROM Semesters AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment AS T2 ON T1.semester_id  =  T2.semester_id GROUP BY T1.semester_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T2.semester_id, T2.semester_name, count(T1.student_id) as student_count FROM Student_Enrolment AS T1 JOIN Semesters AS T2 ON T1.semester_id = T2.semester_id GROUP BY T2.semester_id, T2.semester_name ORDER BY student_count DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

When ordered by the count and limited to 1, Q2 could return either of the two records, depending on which one comes first in the ordering.\n\nThis example shows that the two queries can produce different results, and therefore, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.student_id ,  T1.first_name ,  T1.middle_name ,  T1.last_name ,  count(*) ,  T1.student_id FROM Students AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment AS T2 ON T1.student_id  =  T2.student_id GROUP BY T1.student_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.student_id, T1.first_name, T1.middle_name, T1.last_name, count(T2.student_enrolment_id) as num_enrollments FROM Students AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment AS T2 ON T1.student_id = T2.student_id GROUP BY T1.student_id, T1.first_name, T1.middle_name, T1.last_name ORDER BY num_enrollments DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In Q1, the `count(*)` is used, which counts the number of rows for each group, including NULLs and duplicates. In Q2, `COUNT(T2.student_enrolment_id)` is used, which counts the number of non-NULL `student_enrolment_id` values for each group.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider a modified example database where there is a `NULL` value in the `student_enrolment_id` column of the `Student_Enrolment` table for a student. In this case, Q1 would count this row, but Q2 would not, because `COUNT(column_name)` does not count NULLs in the specified column.\n\nHere's an example modification to the database that would cause the outputs of Q1 and Q2 to differ:\n\nLet's say we have a `Students` table with two students:\n\n```\nStudents\n+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+\n| student_id | first_name | middle_name | last_name |\n+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+\n|          1 | John       | A.          | Doe       |\n|          2 | Jane       | B.          | Smith     |\n+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+\n```\n\nAnd a `Student_Enrolment` table with the following rows:\n\n```\nStudent_Enrolment\n+----------------------+-----------------+-------------+------------+----------------+\n| student_enrolment_id | degree_program_id | semester_id | student_id | other_details |\n+----------------------+-----------------+-------------+------------+----------------+\n|                    1 |               101 |          51 |          1 | ...            |\n|                 NULL |               102 |          52 |          1 | ...            |\n|                    2 |               103 |          53 |          2 | ...            |\n+----------------------+-----------------+-------------+------------+----------------+\n```\n\nIn this case, Q1 would count both rows for `student_id` 1, including the one with `NULL` `student_enrolment_id`, resulting in a count of 2. Q2, however, would only count the row with a non-NULL `student_enrolment_id`, resulting in a count of 1 for `student_id` 1. This difference in counts would lead to different results when ordering by the count and applying the `LIMIT 1` clause, thus proving that the queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.student_id ,  T1.first_name ,  T1.middle_name ,  T1.last_name ,  count(*) ,  T1.student_id FROM Students AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment AS T2 ON T1.student_id  =  T2.student_id GROUP BY T1.student_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.first_name, T1.middle_name, T1.last_name, T1.student_id, COUNT(T2.student_enrolment_id) as num_enrollments FROM Students AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment AS T2 ON T1.student_id = T2.student_id GROUP BY T1.student_id ORDER BY num_enrollments DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Additionally, it implicitly removes duplicates within the first result set itself.\n\nQ2 uses a WHERE clause with a subquery and the NOT IN operator to exclude any students who are present in the Student_Enrolment table.

Assuming this is a typo and correcting it to be consistent in both queries, the difference in handling duplicates still makes the queries not equivalent.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider a Students table with two students having the same last name and living in North Carolina, but only one of them is enrolled in a course.

In such a case, the `GROUP BY` in Q1 would aggregate these addresses, and the `count(*)` would include all students linked to the same `address_id`, even if they are actually different addresses with the same ID.\n\nOn the other hand, Q2 would not aggregate these addresses because it directly selects the `address_id` that has the highest count of students associated with it.

However, it would arbitrarily return one of the two addresses (since `GROUP BY` does not guarantee which row's non-aggregated columns are returned when there are duplicates).\n\nQ2 would return the address with `address_id` 1 that matches the subquery condition, but it would not aggregate multiple rows with the same `address_id`.\n\nSince the two queries can produce different results with this dataset, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.address_id ,  T1.line_1 ,  T1.line_2 FROM Addresses AS T1 JOIN Students AS T2 ON T1.address_id  =  T2.current_address_id GROUP BY T1.address_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT A.address_id, A.line_1, A.line_2, A.line_3 FROM Addresses AS A WHERE A.address_id = (     SELECT S.current_address_id     FROM Students AS S     GROUP BY S.current_address_id     ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC     LIMIT 1 )```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

This means that it will count students based on both their current and permanent addresses.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider the following data:\n\nAddresses table:\n| address_id | line_1     | line_2 | ... |\n|------------|------------|--------|-----|\n| 1          | 123 Main St| Apt 1  | ... |\n| 2          | 456 Elm St | Apt 2  | ... |\n\nStudents table:\n| student_id | current_address_id | permanent_address_id | ... |\n|------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----|\n| 1          | 1                  | 2                    | ... |\n| 2          | 1                  | 2                    | ... |\n| 3          | 2                  | 1                    | ... |\n\nFor Q1, the count of students for each `current_address_id` would be:\n- address_id 1: 2 students\n- address_id 2: 1 student\n\nSo the result would be the address with `address_id` 1.\n\nFor Q2, the count of students for each `address_id` (considering both current and permanent addresses) would be:\n- address_id 1: 3 students (2 current, 1 permanent)\n- address_id 2: 3 students (1 current, 2 permanent)\n\nIn this case, either address could be returned since they both have the same count, but the result is not guaranteed to be the same as Q1 because the ordering of rows with the same count value is not specified and could be arbitrary.\n\nTherefore, since there exists a database (the one provided in the example) for which the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.address_id ,  T1.line_1 ,  T1.line_2 FROM Addresses AS T1 JOIN Students AS T2 ON T1.address_id  =  T2.current_address_id GROUP BY T1.address_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.address_id, T1.line_1, T1.line_2 FROM Addresses AS T1 JOIN Students AS T2 ON T1.address_id = T2.current_address_id OR T1.address_id = T2.permanent_address_id GROUP BY T1.address_id, T1.line_1, T1.line_2 ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It groups by `student_course_id` and orders the results by the count in descending order, then limits the results to the top one.\n\nQ2 attempts to select the maximum count of `student_course_id` from `Transcript_Contents` for each `student_enrolment_id` from `Student_Enrolment_Courses`. It joins the two tables on `student_course_id` and groups by `student_enrolment_id`.\n\nThe key differences are:\n\n1. Q1 is looking for the single `student_course_id` with the most entries in `Transcript_Contents`, while Q2 is looking for the maximum count of entries per `student_enrolment_id`. This means Q2 could potentially return multiple rows (one for each `student_enrolment_id`), while Q1 will always return a single row.\n\n2. Q1 does not involve the `Student_Enrolment_Courses` table at all, while Q2 does. This means that Q2's results are influenced by the presence of `student_enrolment_id`, which could change the count aggregation.\n\n3. Q1's `ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top result is returned, while Q2's `max(count(T1.student_course_id))` is applied within the context of each group defined by `student_enrolment_id`, which could lead to multiple maximum counts if there are multiple `student_enrolment_id` values.\n\nTo illustrate with an example, consider the following data:\n\nTranscript_Contents:\n| student_course_id | transcript_id |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| 1                 | 100           |\n| 1                 | 101           |\n| 2                 | 102           |\n| 3                 | 103           |\n| 3                 | 104           |\n\nStudent_Enrolment_Courses:\n| student_course_id | course_id | student_enrolment_id |\n|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| 1                 | 10        | 200                  |\n| 2                 | 20        | 200                  |\n| 3                 | 30        | 300                  |\n\nQ1 would return:\n| count | student_course_id |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| 2     | 1                 |\n\nQ2 would return:\n| max   | student_enrolment_id |\n|-------|----------------------|\n| 2     | 200                  |\n| 2     | 300                  |\n\nAs you can see, Q1 returns the most frequent `student_course_id`, while Q2 returns the maximum count per `student_enrolment_id`, which is not the same thing.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) ,  student_course_id FROM Transcript_Contents GROUP BY student_course_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT max(count(T1.student_course_id)), T2.student_enrolment_id FROM Transcript_Contents AS T1 JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses AS T2 ON T1.student_course_id  =  T2.student_course_id GROUP BY T2.student_enrolment_id```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The result could be either `2023-01-01` or `2023-01-02` depending on the database's internal handling of the GROUP BY clause.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, explicitly groups by both `transcript_id` and `transcript_date`, ensuring that the count is associated with a specific date. This would result in two groups, one for each date, and the ORDER BY would then apply to these distinct groups.\n\nTherefore, due to the potential for different `transcript_date` values associated with the same `transcript_id`, the two queries can yield different results, proving that they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.transcript_date ,  T1.transcript_id FROM Transcript_Contents AS T1 JOIN Transcripts AS T2 ON T1.transcript_id  =  T2.transcript_id GROUP BY T1.transcript_id ORDER BY count(*) ASC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.transcript_id, T1.transcript_date, COUNT(T2.student_course_id) AS num_results FROM Transcripts AS T1 JOIN Transcript_Contents AS T2 ON T1.transcript_id = T2.transcript_id GROUP BY T1.transcript_id, T1.transcript_date ORDER BY num_results ASC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Since the string inside the quotes is the same, and assuming the SQL database being used allows for this interchangeability of quotes, the two queries will yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to modify the example database such that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, because the difference in quotes does not affect the semantic meaning of the queries. The queries are semantically equivalent and will always return the same result when executed against any database that follows the standard SQL behavior regarding quotes.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT Weekly_Rank FROM TV_series WHERE Episode = \"A Love of a Lifetime\";```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Weekly_Rank FROM TV_series WHERE Episode = 'A Love of a Lifetime'```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Let's break down the queries:\n\nQ1 selects the `id` of `tv_channel` but groups by `country`. This means that it will return the `id` of the first row in each group of channels from the same country, provided that there are more than two channels in that country. However, this is not a valid SQL query because the `id` is not included in an aggregate function nor is it part of the `GROUP BY` clause. This query would typically result in an error in most SQL databases because it violates the SQL standard that requires every column in the select list to be either aggregated or part of the `GROUP BY` clause.\n\nQ2 selects the `id` from `TV_Channel` where the `Country` is in a subquery. The subquery returns countries that have more than two channels. This means that Q2 will return the `id` of every channel in the countries that have more than two channels.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, let's consider an example database:\n\n```\nTV_Channel\nid | series_name | Country\n---|-------------|---------\n1  | SeriesA     | USA\n2  | SeriesB     | USA\n3  | SeriesC     | USA\n4  | SeriesD     | France\n5  | SeriesE     | France\n6  | SeriesF     | Japan\n```\n\nFor Q1, if it were a valid query, it would attempt to return the `id` of the first channel in each country with more than two channels. However, as mentioned, this query would typically result in an error.\n\nFor Q2, the subquery would return 'USA' because it's the only country with more than two channels. Then the outer query would return the `id` of all channels in the USA, which would be 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSince Q1 is not a valid query and does not return a result set, and Q2 returns specific `id`s based on the subquery condition, they are not equivalent. Even if we were to correct Q1 to make it valid by including `id` in an aggregate function or the `GROUP BY` clause, the two queries would still not be equivalent because Q1 would return only one `id` per country, while Q2 would return all `id`s for the countries that meet the condition.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT id FROM tv_channel GROUP BY country HAVING count(*)  >  2```\n\nQ2:```SELECT id FROM TV_Channel WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM TV_Channel GROUP BY Country HAVING count(*) > 2)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

If there is at least one row in the `country` table with `GovernmentForm` set to 'US territory' (with a lowercase 't') and no rows with 'US Territory' (with an uppercase 'T'), then Q1 would return no results (or NULL for the average and zero for the sum), while Q2 would return the average GNP and sum of the population for the row(s) with 'US territory'.\n\nHere is an example modification to the database that would cause the outputs of Q1 and Q2 to be different:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO country (Code, Name, Continent, Region, SurfaceArea, IndepYear, Population, LifeExpectancy, GNP, GNPOld, LocalName, GovernmentForm, HeadOfState, Capital, Code2)\nVALUES ('XYZ', 'ExampleLand', 'North America', 'ExampleRegion', 12345, 1776, 1000000, 75, 50000, 45000, 'ExampleLand', 'US territory', 'Example Leader', 1, 'XL');\n```\n\nAfter inserting this row, Q2 would include this country in its results, while Q1 would not, because of the case-sensitive comparison on `GovernmentForm`.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT avg(GNP) ,  sum(population) FROM country WHERE GovernmentForm  =  \"US Territory\"```\n\nQ2:```SELECT AVG(GNP), SUM(Population) FROM country WHERE GovernmentForm = 'US territory'```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The difference between the two queries is in how they apply the filter conditions and combine the results.\n\nQ1 uses two separate `SELECT` statements combined with a `UNION` operator. Each `SELECT` statement filters the countries by one language ('English' or 'Dutch') and checks if it is an official language (`isofficial = 't'`). The `UNION` operator ensures that each country name appears only once in the result set, even if a country has both English and Dutch as official languages.\n\nQ2 uses a single `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause that combines both language conditions using the `OR` operator. It also checks if the language is official (`isofficial = 'T'`). The result is that any country with either English or Dutch as an official language will be included in the result set.\n\nSince both queries are designed to return unique country names (due to the `UNION` in Q1 and the nature of the `WHERE` clause in Q2), and both apply the same conditions for language and official status, they are semantically equivalent.

Example database and output observation:\n\nLet's consider an example database with the following data in the 'country' table:\n\n| Code | Name     | Continent | Region | SurfaceArea | IndepYear | Population | LifeExpectancy | GNP | GNPOld | LocalName | GovernmentForm | HeadOfState | Capital | Code2 |\n|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------|-------|\n| A    | CountryA | Asia      | East   | 1000        | 1900      | 1000000    | 70             | ... | ...    | ...       | ...            | ...         | ...     | ...   |\n| B    | CountryB | Europe    | North  | 2000        | 1950      | 500000     | 80             | ... | ...    | ...       | ...            | ...         | ...     | ...   |\n| C    | CountryC | Africa    | South  | 3000        | 1960      | 500000     | 60             | ... | ...    | ...       | ...            | ...         | ...     | ...   |\n\nFor Q1, the query will order the countries by population and then limit the result to 1 row. This means it will return the country with the smallest population. However, if there are multiple countries with the same smallest population, it will return the first one based on the default ordering (which could be by the 'Code' or any other default order defined by the SQL engine).\n\nFor Q2, the query will return all countries that have the smallest population. If there are multiple countries with the same smallest population, it will return all of them.\n\nIn the example above, both CountryB and CountryC have the smallest population of 500000. Q1 will return only one of them (let's assume it returns CountryB), while Q2 will return both CountryB and CountryC.\n\n2. Counter example to show non-equivalence:\n\nUsing the same example database, we can see that Q1 and Q2 will produce different results:\n\nQ1 will return:\n| Name     | SurfaceArea | IndepYear |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|\n| CountryB | 2000        | 1950      |\n\nQ2 will return:\n| Name     | IndepYear | SurfaceArea |\n|----------|-----------|-------------|\n| CountryB | 1950      | 2000        |\n| CountryC | 1960      | 3000        |\n\nSince Q1 returns only one row and Q2 can potentially return multiple rows, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT Name ,  SurfaceArea ,  IndepYear FROM country ORDER BY Population LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Name, IndepYear, SurfaceArea FROM country WHERE Population = (SELECT MIN(Population) FROM country)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The 'Monarchy' group has an average life expectancy of 75, so it will be included. The output will be:\n\n| sum(Population) | GovernmentForm |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| 4000000         | Monarchy       |\n\nQ2 will first select the `GovernmentForm` of groups having an average `LifeExpectancy` greater than 72, which are 'Democracy' and 'Monarchy'.

This behavior is not defined in the SQL standard and can vary between different database systems or even different executions on the same system.\n\nOn the other hand, Q2 explicitly includes T1.Language in the SELECT clause but not in the GROUP BY clause, which is actually not allowed in standard SQL because every column in the SELECT clause that is not an aggregate function must be included in the GROUP BY clause. However, some database systems like MySQL with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY disabled or SQLite might allow this and return a random LANGUAGE value for each CountryCode, which might not be the one with the max(Percentage).\n\nHere is an example database that would show the difference:\n\n```\ncountrylanguage table:\n+-------------+----------+------------+------------+\n| CountryCode | Language | IsOfficial | Percentage |\n+-------------+----------+------------+------------+\n| USA         | English  | T          | 80.0       |\n| USA         | Spanish  | F          | 12.0       |\n| CAN         | English  | T          | 75.0       |\n| CAN         | French   | T          | 23.0       |\n+-------------+----------+------------+------------+\n```\n\nFor this example, Q1 might return:\n```\n+----------+-------------+-----------------+\n| LANGUAGE | CountryCode | max(Percentage) |\n+----------+-------------+-----------------+\n| English  | USA         | 80.0            |\n| English  | CAN         | 75.0            |\n+----------+-------------+-----------------+\n```\n\nWhile Q2 might return:\n```\n+-------------+----------+-----------------+\n| CountryCode | Language | max(Percentage) |\n+-------------+----------+-----------------+\n| USA         | English  | 80.0            |\n| CAN         | English  | 75.0            |\n+-------------+----------+-----------------+\n```\n\nIn this case, the results are the same, but if the database system chooses a different LANGUAGE for the first query, the results would differ.

The only differences between the two queries are the use of different quote styles for the string \"Live final\" and the case sensitivity of the column name \"Share\" and \"Type\".\n\nIn SQL, string literals can be represented with either single quotes ('Live final') or double quotes (\"Live final\"), depending on the SQL dialect. However, in standard SQL, single quotes are used for string literals, and double quotes are used for identifiers (such as column names). Since the string \"Live final\" is a literal and not an identifier, both single and double quotes are acceptable for representing the string, and they are functionally equivalent.\n\nRegarding the case sensitivity of the column names, SQL is generally case-insensitive for identifiers, meaning that \"SHARE\" and \"Share\" or \"TYPE\" and \"Type\" would be considered the same. However, some database systems can be configured to be case-sensitive. In the context of this question, we assume that the database system is using the default case-insensitivity for identifiers.\n\nGiven these considerations, both Q1 and Q2 will yield identical results for all possible databases that adhere to the standard SQL behavior regarding string literals and case sensitivity for identifiers.

They are grouping by `Conductor_ID` to count the number of orchestras associated with each conductor. The `ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1` clause is used to find the conductor associated with the most orchestras.\n\nIn Q1, the grouping is done only by `T2.Conductor_ID`, which is sufficient because `Conductor_ID` is unique in the `conductor` table (as it is a primary key). The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses will ensure that only the conductor with the highest count of orchestras is selected, and since `T1.Name` is functionally dependent on `T1.Conductor_ID`, there is no ambiguity in selecting the name.\n\nIn Q2, the grouping is done by both `T1.Conductor_ID` and `T1.Name`. This is effectively the same as grouping by `T1.Conductor_ID` alone because `T1.Name` is functionally dependent on `T1.Conductor_ID` (assuming that each conductor has a unique ID and, therefore, a unique name). The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses have the same effect as in Q1.\n\nSince both queries will always return the name of the conductor with the highest count of orchestras, and there can only be one such conductor due to the `LIMIT 1` clause, the queries are equivalent.

The `EXCEPT` operator filters out all rows from the first query that are found in the second query, regardless of NULLs. However, the `NOT IN` subquery will not work as expected if there are any NULL values in the subquery's result set.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Q1 uses the `EXCEPT` operator, which will return all `id` values from the `Highschooler` table that are not present in the `Friend` table's `student_id` column. It will work correctly even if there are NULL values in the `Friend` table's `student_id` column.\n\n2. Q2 uses a `NOT IN` subquery, which will return all `ID` values from the `Highschooler` table where the `ID` is not in the list of `student_id` from the `Friend` table. However, if the subquery (`SELECT student_id FROM Friend`) returns any NULL values, the entire `NOT IN` condition will evaluate to unknown, and the query will return an empty set.\n\nTo demonstrate the difference, consider the following example database:\n\nHighschooler table:\n| ID | name | grade |\n|----|------|-------|\n| 1  | John | 10    |\n| 2  | Jane | 11    |\n| 3  | Jake | 12    |\n\nFriend table:\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| NULL       | 3         |\n\nFor Q1, the result will be:\n| id |\n|----|\n| 2  |\n| 3  |\n\nFor Q2, if we assume standard SQL behavior where comparison with NULL yields unknown, the result will be an empty set because the `NOT IN` subquery contains a NULL, which causes the `NOT IN` condition to fail for all rows.\n\nTherefore, since there is a possible database configuration (with NULL values in the `Friend` table's `student_id` column) where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT id FROM Highschooler EXCEPT SELECT student_id FROM Friend```\n\nQ2:```SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Let's break down each query:\n\nQ1 uses the `INTERSECT` operator, which returns the distinct common elements from both the `Friend` and `Likes` tables. It selects the `student_id` from the `Friend` table and the `liked_id` from the `Likes` table and returns the intersection of these two sets.\n\nQ2 performs an inner join between the `Friend` and `Likes` tables on the condition that `Friend.student_id` is equal to `Likes.liked_id`. It then selects the distinct `student_id` from the result of the join.\n\nBoth queries will yield the same result set because:\n\n- The `INTERSECT` operator inherently returns distinct values that are common to both queries.\n- The `JOIN` operation in Q2, combined with the `DISTINCT` keyword, also returns distinct values that are common to both tables based on the join condition.\n- The join condition in Q2 (`T1.student_id = T2.liked_id`) ensures that only matching `student_id` values from both tables are selected.\n- Since the `student_id` in the `Friend` table and the `liked_id` in the `Likes` table are both foreign keys that reference the `ID` in the `Highschooler` table, the values are from the same domain and can be compared directly.\n\nTherefore, for all possible databases adhering to the given schema, Q1 and Q2 will produce identical results, making the two queries semantically equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT student_id FROM Friend INTERSECT SELECT liked_id FROM Likes```\n\nQ2:```SELECT DISTINCT T1.student_id FROM Friend AS T1 JOIN Likes AS T2 ON T1.student_id = T2.liked_id```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, there is a subtle difference in how they operate, which can lead to different results.\n\nThe difference lies in the fact that Q1 groups by T1.student_id and selects T2.name, which means it will return the name of the student for each unique student_id in the Friend table. If a student has multiple entries in the Friend table (i.e., they have multiple friends), their name will still appear only once in the result set of Q1.\n\nOn the other hand, Q2 does not have such a grouping and could potentially return the same student's name multiple times if the subquery returns the same student_id multiple times (which could happen if the student is friends with multiple people).\n\nTo find a counterexample, we need to construct a case where a student has multiple friends, and thus their student_id appears multiple times in the Friend table, but they only appear once in the result of Q1 and potentially multiple times in the result of Q2.\n\nLet's consider the following example database:\n\nHighschooler:\n| ID | name | grade |\n|----|------|-------|\n| 1  | John | 6     |\n| 2  | Jane | 6     |\n| 3  | Jake | 7     |\n\nFriend:\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 1          | 3         |\n| 2          | 1         |\n| 3          | 1         |\n\nIn this example, John (ID 1) has two friends (Jane and Jake), and both Jane and Jake are also friends with John.\n\nRunning Q1 will return John's name once because it groups by student_id and John's student_id (1) will have a count of 2 friends.\n\nRunning Q2 will also return John's name once because the subquery will return student_id 1 once, and then the main query will select John's name from the Highschooler table where ID is 1.\n\nSince both queries return the same result for this example, we have not found a counterexample. However, we need to consider if there is any possible database configuration where the results could differ.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we can see that both queries are indeed equivalent. The subquery in Q2 ensures that each student_id is unique in the list of IDs to be checked against the Highschooler table, and Q1's GROUP BY clause ensures that each student_id is grouped uniquely before applying the HAVING clause.\n\nTherefore, for all possible databases, the two queries will yield identical results, and we can conclude:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.name FROM Friend AS T1 JOIN Highschooler AS T2 ON T1.student_id  =  T2.id WHERE T2.grade  >  5 GROUP BY T1.student_id HAVING count(*)  >=  2```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.name FROM Highschooler AS T1 WHERE T1.grade > 5 AND T1.ID IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend GROUP BY student_id HAVING count(*) >= 2)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The key difference between the two queries is the placement of parentheses in Q2, which changes the order of operations for the UNION operator.\n\nHere's an example database that will produce different results for Q1 and Q2:\n\nLet's say we have the following data in the Professionals and Treatments tables:\n\nProfessionals:\n| professional_id | last_name | cell_number | state      |\n|-----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| 1               | Smith     | 1234567890  | Indiana    |\n| 2               | Johnson   | 2345678901  | Indiana    |\n| 3               | Williams  | 3456789012  | Ohio       |\n\nTreatments:\n| treatment_id | dog_id | professional_id | treatment_type_code | date_of_treatment | cost_of_treatment |\n|--------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 1            | 10     | 1               | A                   | 2023-01-01        | 100               |\n| 2            | 11     | 1               | B                   | 2023-01-02        | 150               |\n| 3            | 12     | 1               | C                   | 2023-01-03        | 200               |\n| 4            | 13     | 2               | A                   | 2023-01-04        | 100               |\n| 5            | 14     | 2               | B                   | 2023-01-05        | 150               |\n\nIn this example, professional_id 1 from Indiana has more than 2 treatments, and professional_id 2 from Indiana has exactly 2 treatments.\n\nFor Q1, the UNION operator will combine the results of the two SELECT statements without duplicates. Since professional_id 1 is selected in both parts of the UNION, it will appear only once in the final result. Professional_id 2 will not be included in the second part of the UNION because it does not have more than 2 treatments.\n\nFor Q2, the parentheses around the second SELECT statement mean that the UNION operation will be applied to the entire subquery. This does not change the logic in this case, as UNION is still combining the results of two SELECT statements without duplicates.\n\nSince both queries are using UNION (not UNION ALL), duplicates are eliminated in both cases. Therefore, the presence or absence of parentheses does not affect the result in this example.\n\nHowever, if we modify the example database such that professional_id 2 has 3 treatments instead of 2, the output of Q1 and Q2 would still be the same because UNION removes duplicates. The parentheses do not change the fact that UNION is used to combine the results without duplicates.\n\nIn conclusion, the two queries are equivalent because the use of parentheses in Q2 does not change the semantics of the UNION operation in this context.

The difference arises from the GROUP BY clause in the subqueries of Q1 and Q2.\n\nIn Q1, the GROUP BY clause only includes `T1.professional_id`, which means that the grouping is done solely based on the `professional_id`. This allows for the possibility of having multiple rows with the same `professional_id` but different `last_name` or `cell_number` values in the result set if such rows exist in the Professionals table.\n\nIn Q2, the GROUP BY clause includes `T1.professional_id`, `T1.last_name`, and `T1.cell_number`, which means that the grouping is done based on the combination of `professional_id`, `last_name`, and `cell_number`. This ensures that the result set will not have multiple rows with the same `professional_id` if the `last_name` or `cell_number` are different.\n\nHere's an example that would cause the outputs of Q1 and Q2 to differ:\n\nLet's say we have the following rows in the Professionals table:\n\n| professional_id | last_name | cell_number | state      |\n|-----------------|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| 1               | Smith     | 1234567890  | Indiana    |\n| 1               | Smith     | 0987654321  | Indiana    |\n\nAnd the following rows in the Treatments table:\n\n| treatment_id | dog_id | professional_id | treatment_type_code | date_of_treatment | cost_of_treatment |\n|--------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 1            | 10     | 1               | A                   | 2023-01-01        | 100               |\n| 2            | 11     | 1               | B                   | 2023-01-02        | 150               |\n| 3            | 12     | 1               | C                   | 2023-01-03        | 200               |\n\nProfessional with `professional_id` 1 has performed more than 2 treatments, so they meet the HAVING count(*) > 2 condition.\n\nFor Q1, the UNION will combine the results from the first SELECT (which selects professionals from Indiana) with the results from the second SELECT (which selects professionals with more than 2 treatments). Since the GROUP BY in the second SELECT only includes `professional_id`, it will return both rows for professional_id 1, despite the different `cell_number`.\n\nFor Q2, the UNION will also combine results from the first SELECT with the second SELECT, but the GROUP BY in the second SELECT includes `professional_id`, `last_name`, and `cell_number`.

Let's break down the queries:\n\nQ1 uses the `UNION` operator to combine the first names from the Professionals and Owners tables, ensuring that duplicates are removed. Then it uses the `EXCEPT` operator to remove any names that appear in the Dogs table.\n\nQ2 creates a subquery (aliased as T1) that performs the same `UNION` operation as Q1 to combine and deduplicate the first names from Professionals and Owners. Then, the main query uses a `WHERE` clause with a `NOT IN` subquery to filter out the names that appear in the Dogs table.\n\nBoth queries effectively perform the same operations but in a slightly different order. Q1 combines the names and then subtracts the dog names, while Q2 combines the names and then filters out the dog names. The end result is the same: a list of first names from Professionals and Owners that are not in the Dogs table.\n\nSince the `UNION` operator inherently removes duplicates and the `EXCEPT` and `NOT IN` operations are both used to exclude the names found in the Dogs table, the two queries are semantically equivalent.

Since it does not include `T2.first_name` and `T2.last_name` in the GROUP BY clause, it will not cause any issues if the SQL mode allows it or if the database is using a MySQL version prior to 5.7.5 with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY disabled. It will return the owner with the most dogs, which is Jane Doe with 3 dogs.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, includes `T2.first_name` and `T2.last_name` in the GROUP BY clause. This means it will group by the unique combination of `T1.owner_id`, `T2.first_name`, and `T2.last_name`. Since there is only one row per owner in the Owners table, this will not change the result, and it will also return Jane Doe with 3 dogs.\n\nHowever, if we modify the Owners table to have two entries with the same `owner_id` but different `first_name` and/or `last_name`, the queries will produce different results:\n\nModified Owners Table:\n| owner_id | first_name | last_name |\n|----------|------------|-----------|\n|        1 | John       | Doe       |\n|        1 | Jonathan   | Doe       |\n|        2 | Jane       | Doe       |\n\nNow, Q1 will still return the owner with the most dogs, which is owner_id 1 with 2 dogs (since it only groups by `owner_id`).\n\nQ2, however, will group by the combination of `owner_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`, and since there are two different names for `owner_id` 1, it will treat them as separate groups. It will still return the owner with the most dogs, but it will only consider one of the entries for `owner_id` 1, resulting in a different output than Q1.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.owner_id ,  T2.first_name ,  T2.last_name FROM Dogs AS T1 JOIN Owners AS T2 ON T1.owner_id  =  T2.owner_id GROUP BY T1.owner_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T2.owner_id, T2.first_name, T2.last_name FROM Dogs AS T1 JOIN Owners AS T2 ON T1.owner_id = T2.owner_id GROUP BY T1.owner_id, T2.first_name, T2.last_name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The output of Q2 will also be \"Treatment A\" for the same reason.\n\nHowever, if we modify the Treatments table to have two entries for treatment_type_code 2 with different costs, such as:\n\nTreatments\n| treatment_id | dog_id | professional_id | treatment_type_code | date_of_treatment | cost_of_treatment |\n|--------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 1            | 10     | 100             | 1                   | 2023-01-01        | 100               |\n| 2            | 20     | 100             | 2                   | 2023-01-02        | 30                |\n| 3            | 20     | 100             | 2                   | 2023-01-03        | 20                |\n\nNow, the output of Q1 will still be \"Treatment A\" because it has a total cost of 100.

Here's a counterexample:\n\nLet's assume we have the following data in the Owners table:\n\n| owner_id | zip_code |\n|----------|----------|\n| 1        | 12345    |\n| 2        | 12345    |\n\nAnd the following data in the Dogs table:\n\n| dog_id | owner_id |\n|--------|----------|\n| 1      | 1        |\n| 2      | 2        |\n\nAnd the following data in the Treatments table:\n\n| treatment_id | dog_id | cost_of_treatment |\n|--------------|--------|-------------------|\n| 1            | 1      | 100               |\n| 2            | 2      | 200               |\n\nNow, let's look at the output of both queries:\n\nQ1 will group by `owner_id` only, and since both owners are from the same zip code, it will sum up the cost of treatments for each owner and return the owner with the highest total cost. In this case, it will return:\n\n| owner_id | zip_code |\n|----------|----------|\n| 2        | 12345    |\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will group by both `owner_id` and `zip_code`. Since both owners have the same zip code, it will also sum up the cost of treatments for each owner and return the owner with the highest total cost. The result will be the same as Q1 in this particular case:\n\n| owner_id | zip_code |\n|----------|----------|\n| 2        | 12345    |\n\nHowever, if we modify the zip code for one of the owners in the Owners table, like this:\n\n| owner_id | zip_code |\n|----------|----------|\n| 1        | 12345    |\n| 2        | 67890    |\n\nThe output of Q1 will remain the same because it does not consider the zip code in the grouping, but Q2 will now consider the zip code as part of the grouping, which could potentially change the ordering if there were more rows or different sums of treatment costs for different zip codes.\n\nIn this modified example, the output of Q1 and Q2 would still be the same because there is only one row per owner_id. However, if there were multiple rows with different zip codes for the same owner_id, and the sum of the cost_of_treatment was the same for owners in different zip codes, Q2 could potentially return a different owner_id and zip_code combination than Q1 because it groups by both owner_id and zip_code, which could lead to different sums being considered in the ORDER BY clause.\n\nTherefore, since there exists a scenario where Q1 and Q2 could produce different results, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.owner_id ,  T1.zip_code FROM Owners AS T1 JOIN Dogs AS T2 ON T1.owner_id  =  T2.owner_id JOIN Treatments AS T3 ON T2.dog_id  =  T3.dog_id GROUP BY T1.owner_id ORDER BY sum(T3.cost_of_treatment) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.owner_id, T1.zip_code FROM Owners AS T1 JOIN Dogs AS T2 ON T1.owner_id = T2.owner_id JOIN Treatments AS T3 ON T2.dog_id = T3.dog_id GROUP BY T1.owner_id, T1.zip_code ORDER BY SUM(T3.cost_of_treatment) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Since all professional_ids in the Treatments table must have a corresponding entry in the Professionals table (due to the foreign key constraint), the result will also be 1.\n\nHowever, if we modify the Professionals table to include a professional who has not performed any treatments, the results will differ:\n\nModified Professionals Table:\n| professional_id | role_code | first_name | ... |\n|-----------------|-----------|------------|-----|\n| 1               | R1        | John       | ... |\n| 2               | R2        | Jane       | ... |\n| 3               | R3        | Bob        | ... |\n| 4               | R4        | Alice      | ... | (no corresponding Treatments entry)\n\nNow, Q1 will still return 1 because it only looks at the Treatments table and counts the distinct professional_ids that have performed treatments.\n\nHowever, Q2 will join the Professionals table with the Treatments table and count the distinct professional_ids. Since professional_id 4 has not performed any treatments, it will not be included in the join, and the count will still be 1.\n\nIn this case, the outputs are still identical, but we can see that the potential for a discrepancy exists if there are professionals who have not performed any treatments. The foreign key constraint ensures that every professional_id in the Treatments table has a corresponding entry in the Professionals table, but it does not ensure that every professional_id in the Professionals table has a corresponding entry in the Treatments table.\n\nTherefore, if there is a professional in the Professionals table who has not performed any treatments, Q1 will not count them, but Q2 will count them if they have performed at least one treatment.

Since `NULL` is not considered equal to any value, including another `NULL`, the subquery `(SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments)` will return `NULL` and `1`. The `NOT IN` clause will exclude any `professional_id` that is in this list, so it will count all professionals except those with `professional_id` of `1`. The result will be a count of 1 (only professional with `professional_id` 2).\n\nQ2: `SELECT COUNT(professional_id) FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments)`\n\nThis query is similar to Q1, but it uses `COUNT(professional_id)` instead of `count(*)`. The difference is that `COUNT(professional_id)` will not count `NULL` values in the `professional_id` column of the `Professionals` table. However, since the `professional_id` column in the `Professionals` table is likely a primary key and cannot be `NULL`, this difference does not affect the result. The result will be the same as Q1, a count of 1.\n\nHowever, if the `Professionals` table were to allow `NULL` values in the `professional_id` column (which would be unusual for a primary key), and there was a row with a `NULL` `professional_id`, then Q1 would count that row, but Q2 would not, because `COUNT(column_name)` does not include `NULL` values in its count.\n\nSince the `professional_id` in the `Professionals` table is a primary key and cannot be `NULL` based on the database schema provided, the presence of `NULL` in the `Treatments` table's `professional_id` column does not affect the equivalence of the two queries. Therefore, for all possible databases adhering to the given schema, the two queries are equivalent.\n\nHowever, the question asks for a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical. Since the schema specifies that `professional_id` is a primary key in the `Professionals` table, it cannot be `NULL`, and thus no such counterexample exists within the constraints of the given schema.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN ( SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments )```\n\nQ2:```SELECT COUNT(professional_id) FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

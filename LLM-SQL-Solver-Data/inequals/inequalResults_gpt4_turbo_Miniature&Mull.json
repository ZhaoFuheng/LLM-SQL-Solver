Then it joins the `Parts` table with the `Temp` CTE on `pnum` and compares the `qoh` with the count of `shipdate`s (`ct`).\n\nBoth queries will produce the same result set for any given content of the `Parts` and `Supply` tables, as they both implement the same logic using different SQL constructs."}, "1": {"prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2.\nYour task is to quietly think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are semantic equivalent based on the DATABASE SCHEMA.\nReturn EQUIVALENT or NOT EQUIVALENT in Answer.

It has two parts combined with a UNION ALL:\n\n1. The first part of the union performs a self-join on tableA (which is redundant because it joins on x.id = y.id, so it's effectively the same as just selecting from tableA) and then joins with tableB on the age column. This part is equivalent to Q1 because the self-join on tableA does not change the result set due to the join condition x.id = y.id.\n\n2. The second part of the union selects a constant value (1) where 1 = 0. This condition is always false, so this part of the union will never contribute any rows to the result set.\n\nSince the second part of Q2's union does not add any rows to the result, and the first part of Q2 is equivalent to Q1, the two queries are semantically equivalent.

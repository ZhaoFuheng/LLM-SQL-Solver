T2.stadium_id WHERE T1.year  >=  2014 GROUP BY T2.stadium_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1\n\nThis query will join the concert and stadium tables on the stadium_id column, filter the concerts with a

T1.Continent  =  T2.ContId JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T3 ON T1.CountryId  =  T3.Country WHERE T2.Continent  =  'europe' GROUP BY T1.CountryName HAVING count(*)  >=  3;```\n\nOutput of Q1:

Example Database:\nLet's consider a small example database with the following data:\n\ncar_makers:\nId | Maker | FullName | Country\n-------------------------------\n1  | Ford  | Ford Inc | USA\n2  | Honda | Honda Ltd| Japan\n\ncar_names:\nMakeId | Model | Make\n---------------------\n1      | Focus | Ford\n2      | Civic | Honda\n\ncars_data:\nId | MPG | Cylinders | Edispl | Horsepower | Weight | Accelerate | Year\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1  | 30  | 3         | 2.0    | 150        | 2500   | 10         | 2019\n2  | 35  | 4         | 1.8    | 140        | 2400   | 9.5        | 2018\n\n2. Output of Q1:\nQ1: SELECT T2.horsepower, T1.Make FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId = T2.Id WHERE T2.cylinders = 3 ORDER BY T2.horsepower DESC LIMIT 1;\n\nThe query joins the car_names and cars_data tables on the MakeId and Id columns respectively. It selects the horsepower and Make columns from the joined tables where the cylinders value is 3. It then orders the result by horsepower in descending order and limits the result to 1 row.\n\nIn our example database, the only row in the cars_data table with cylinders = 3 has a horsepower value of 150 and a MakeId of 1. The corresponding Make in the car_names table for MakeId 1 is \"Ford\". Therefore, the output of Q1 would be:\n\nhorsepower | Make\n-----------------\n150        | Ford\n\n3. Output of Q2:\nQ2: SELECT max(T1.Horsepower), T2.Make FROM cars_data AS T1 JOIN car_names AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.MakeId WHERE T1.Cylinders = 3 GROUP BY T2.Make;\n\nThe query joins the cars_data and car_names tables on the Id and MakeId columns respectively. It selects the maximum Horsepower value from cars_data and the Make from car_names where the cylinders value is 3. It groups the result by Make.\n\nIn our example database, the only row in the cars_data table with cylinders = 3 has a horsepower value of 150 and a MakeId of 1. The corresponding Make in the car_names table for MakeId 1 is \"Ford\". Since there is only one row in the result, the maximum Horsepower value is also 150. Therefore, the output of Q2 would be:\n\nmax(T1.Horsepower) | T2.Make\n----------------------------\n150                | Ford\n\n4. Comparison of Outputs:\nThe outputs of Q1 and Q2 for our example database are identical:\n\nQ1 output: 150, Ford\nQ2 output: 150, Ford\n\nTherefore, for this example database, the two SQL queries Q1 and Q2 are equivalent.\n\n5. Modification of Example Database:\nWe cannot modify the example database in a way that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical. This is because the two queries are essentially performing the same operations, just in a slightly different order. Q1 first filters the data based on cylinders and then finds the maximum horsepower, while Q2 first finds the maximum horsepower and then filters the data based on cylinders. As long as the data in the database remains consistent, the outputs of the two queries will always be the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is THE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.horsepower ,  T1.Make FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId  =  T2.Id WHERE T2.cylinders  =  3 ORDER BY T2.horsepower DESC LIMIT 1;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT max(T1.Horsepower), T2.Make FROM cars_data AS T1 JOIN car_names AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.MakeId WHERE T1.Cylinders = 3 GROUP BY T2.Make```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, the output of Q2 would be:\n\nModel | COUNT(*)\n------|---------\nB     | 3\n\nTherefore, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical for this modified example database.\n\n6.

The EXCEPT operator is used to return the airlines from the first subquery that are not present in the second subquery. Finally, the main query selects the airlines from the airlines table that match the result of the EXCEPT operation.\n\nIn our example database, the first subquery will return all airlines (1, 2, 3) because they all have flights with SourceAirport = 'CVO'. The second subquery will return an empty result set because there are no flights with SourceAirport = 'APG'. Therefore, the EXCEPT operator will return all airlines (1, 2, 3).

The second part of Q1 will now return the airline with uid 1 (AA) because it has a flight with SourceAirport = \"APG\". Therefore, the EXCEPT operator will return the airlines BA and UA.\n\nOn the other hand, Q2 will still return all airlines (1, 2, 3) because they all have flights with SourceAirport = 'CVO'. The second subquery will now return the airline with uid 1 (AA) because it has a flight with SourceAirport = 'APG'. Therefore, the EXCEPT operator will return the airlines 2 and 3. The main query will then select the airlines with uid 2 and 3, which correspond to BA and UA.\n\nAs we can see, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical in this modified database.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: THE ANSWER IS NOT EQUIVALENT.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Airline FROM AIRLINES AS T1 JOIN FLIGHTS AS T2 ON T1.uid  =  T2.Airline WHERE T2.SourceAirport  =  \"CVO\" EXCEPT SELECT T1.Airline FROM AIRLINES AS T1 JOIN FLIGHTS AS T2 ON T1.uid  =  T2.Airline WHERE T2.SourceAirport  =  \"APG\"```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Airline FROM airlines WHERE uid IN (SELECT Airline FROM flights WHERE SourceAirport = 'CVO') EXCEPT SELECT Airline FROM airlines WHERE uid IN (SELECT Airline FROM flights WHERE SourceAirport = 'APG')```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Q1 directly selects the winner_name and winner_rank columns, while Q2 joins the players table to get the first_name and last_name of the winners. However, since the player_id is the primary key in the players table, there can only be one row for each player_id, and therefore, the first_name and last_name will always be the same for a given winner_id.

Output of Q1:\nQ1: SELECT first_name FROM Students WHERE current_address_id != permanent_address_id\n\nThe query selects the first_name from the Students table where the current_address_id is not equal to the permanent_address_id. In our example database, the first row has different current and permanent addresses, so it will be selected. The second and third rows have the same current and permanent addresses, so they will not be selected.\n\nOutput of Q1: John\n\n3. Output of Q2:\nQ2: SELECT first_name FROM Students WHERE current_address_id != permanent_address_id LIMIT 1\n\nThe query is the same as Q1, but it also includes a LIMIT 1 clause, which limits the result to only one row.\n\nOutput of Q2: John\n\n4. Comparison of Outputs:\nThe outputs of Q1 and Q2 are identical in our example database. The query Q2 only limits the result to one row, but in this case, there is only one row that satisfies the condition, so the outputs are the same.\n\n5. Modification of Example Database:\nIn this example database, we cannot modify it in a way that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical.

Example Database:\nLet's consider a simple example database with the following data in the Transcripts table:\n\ntranscript_id | transcript_date | other_details\n--------------|-----------------|--------------\n1             | 2021-01-01      | ...\n2             | 2021-02-01      | ...\n3             | 2021-03-01      | ...\n\n2. Output of Q1:\n```SELECT transcript_date FROM Transcripts ORDER BY transcript_date DESC LIMIT 1```\nThis query selects the transcript_date column from the Transcripts table, orders the results in descending order based on transcript_date, and limits the result to only the first row. In our example database, the result of this query would be \"2021-03-01\".\n\n3. Output of Q2:\n```SELECT max(transcript_date) FROM Transcripts```\nThis query selects the maximum value of the transcript_date column from the Transcripts table. In our example database, the result of this query would also be \"2021-03-01\".\n\nSince the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are identical for our example database, we can conclude that the two SQL queries are equivalent.\n\n4. Modifying the example database:\nNow, let's modify the example database by changing the transcript_date of the third row to a different date, such as \"2021-04-01\".\n\ntranscript_id | transcript_date | other_details\n--------------|-----------------|--------------\n1             | 2021-01-01      | ...\n2             | 2021-02-01      | ...\n3             | 2021-04-01      | ...\n\n5. Output of Q1:\n```SELECT transcript_date FROM Transcripts ORDER BY transcript_date DESC LIMIT 1```\nThe result of this query would now be \"2021-04-01\", as it selects the most recent transcript_date.\n\n6. Output of Q2:\n```SELECT max(transcript_date) FROM Transcripts```\nThe result of this query would still be \"2021-03-01\", as it selects the maximum value of the transcript_date column, which is still \"2021-03-01\".\n\nTherefore, we have found a counter example where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical.

Therefore, the two SQL queries are equivalent.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can modify the example database such that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical.\n\nIf we modify the VOTES table by adding a new row with state = 'NY' and contestant_number = 3, the counts for area_code 123 and 456 will be different.\n\nModified VOTES:\nvote_id | phone_number | state | contestant_number | created\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n1       | 1111111111   | NY    | 1                 | 2021-01-01\n2       | 2222222222   | NY    | 2                 | 2021-01-02\n3       | 3333333333   | CA    | 1                 | 2021-01-03\n4       | 4444444444   | CA    | 2                 | 2021-01-04\n5       | 5555555555   | NY    | 3                 | 2021-01-05\n\nNow, the count for area_code 123 is 3 and the count for area_code 456 is 2. The query Q1 will return area_code 123, while Q2 will still return area_code 123. Therefore, even with this modification, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are still identical.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the two SQL queries Q1 and Q2 are equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.area_code FROM area_code_state AS T1 JOIN votes AS T2 ON T1.state  =  T2.state GROUP BY T1.area_code ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT area_code FROM AREA_CODE_STATE as acs JOIN VOTES as v ON acs.state = v.state GROUP BY acs.area_code ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It selects the \"Language\" column from the \"countrylanguage\" table. The condition \"WHERE T1.Name = 'Aruba'\" filters the rows where the country name is \"Aruba\". The result is then ordered by the \"Percentage\" column in descending order and limited to 1 row.\n\nIn our example database, the result of Q1 would be:\n\nLanguage\n--------\nEnglish\n\nQ2: SELECT Language FROM countrylanguage WHERE CountryCode = (SELECT Code FROM country WHERE Name = \"Aruba\") AND IsOfficial = \"T\"\n\nThis query first executes the subquery \"(SELECT Code FROM country WHERE Name = 'Aruba')\" to get the country code for \"Aruba\". It then selects the \"Language\" column from the \"countrylanguage\" table where the \"CountryCode\" is equal to the result of the subquery and the \"IsOfficial\" column is equal to \"T\".\n\nIn our example database, the result of the subquery would be:\n\nCode\n----\nABW\n\nThe result of Q2 would be:\n\nLanguage\n--------\nEnglish\n\nComparing the outputs of Q1 and Q2, we can see that they are identical.

However, the result of Q1 would still be \"English\" because it does not have the \"IsOfficial\" condition.\n\nTherefore, even with this modification, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are still identical.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the two SQL queries Q1 and Q2 are equivalent for all possible databases.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.Language FROM country AS T1 JOIN countrylanguage AS T2 ON T1.Code  =  T2.CountryCode WHERE T1.Name  =  \"Aruba\" ORDER BY Percentage DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Language FROM countrylanguage WHERE CountryCode = (SELECT Code FROM country WHERE Name = \"Aruba\") AND IsOfficial = \"T\"```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

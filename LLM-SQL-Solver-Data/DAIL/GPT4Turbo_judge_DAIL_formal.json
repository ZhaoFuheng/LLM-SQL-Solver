It does this by performing two separate joins and intersections to ensure that the student has a pet of type 'cat' and also a pet of type 'dog'.\n\nQ2 is selecting the first names (`Fname`) from the `Student` table where the `StuID` is in a subquery that selects `StuID` from the `Has_Pet` table.

It also uses a subquery to exclude students who have cats.\n\nQ2 selects the first name and age of students who have dogs but do not have cats as well. It uses subqueries to find the `StuID` of students who have dogs and excludes those who have cats.\n\nAt first glance, both queries seem to be doing the same thing: selecting students who have dogs and do not have cats. However, to be certain, we need to consider all possible edge cases.\n\nLet's consider a case where a student has multiple pets, including both a dog and a cat. In Q1, this student would be excluded from the result set because the subquery would find that they have a cat, and the `NOT IN` condition would filter them out. In Q2, the same logic applies: the student would be included in the first subquery for having a dog but excluded by the second subquery for having a cat.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that both queries are designed to produce the same result set for all possible databases, as they both aim to include students with dogs and exclude those with cats, regardless of any other pets they might have.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider the possibility of a student who has multiple records in the `has_pet` table with the same `petid` (which should not happen in a well-designed database with proper constraints, but could occur if there are data integrity issues). In such a case, Q1 might produce duplicate rows for that student because it's joining tables and a student with multiple identical `petid` entries would join multiple times. Q2, on the other hand, would not produce duplicates because it uses `IN` with subqueries, which inherently filters out duplicates.\n\nSince the database schema specifies that `Pets.PetID` is a primary key, we can assume that there will be no duplicates in the `Pets` table, and therefore, no student should have multiple identical `petid` entries in the `has_pet` table. Given this constraint, both queries should produce the same result set.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis and the constraints provided by the database schema, we can conclude that:\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.fname ,  T1.age FROM student AS T1 JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1.stuid  =  T2.stuid JOIN pets AS T3 ON T3.petid  =  T2.petid WHERE T3.pettype  =  'dog' AND T1.stuid NOT IN (SELECT T1.stuid FROM student AS T1 JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1.stuid  =  T2.stuid JOIN pets AS T3 ON T3.petid  =  T2.petid WHERE T3.pettype  =  'cat')```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Fname, Age FROM Student WHERE StuID IN (SELECT StuID FROM Has_Pet WHERE PetID IN (SELECT PetID FROM Pets WHERE PetType = 'Dog')) AND StuID NOT IN (SELECT StuID FROM Has_Pet WHERE PetID IN (SELECT PetID FROM Pets WHERE PetType = 'Cat'))```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The key difference between the two queries is how they count the rows from the joined tables. Q1 uses `count(*)` which counts all rows, including duplicates and rows with NULL values, while Q2 uses `count(T2.CountryId)` which counts only the non-NULL values of `T2.CountryId`.\n\nHere's an example that will produce different results for Q1 and Q2:\n\nLet's assume we have the following data in our `continents` and `countries` tables:\n\ncontinents:\n| ContId | Continent |\n|--------|-----------|\n| 1      | Asia      |\n| 2      | Europe    |\n\ncountries:\n| CountryId | CountryName | Continent |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| 1         | China       | 1         |\n| 2         | India       | 1         |\n| 3         | NULL        | 1         |  <-- This row has a NULL CountryName\n\nNow, let's run Q1 and Q2 on this data.\n\nQ1 will count all rows, including the one with the NULL `CountryName`, so the result for Asia will be a count of 3.\n\nQ2, however, will count only non-NULL `CountryId` values, so the result for Asia will also be a count of 3 because `CountryId` is a primary key and cannot be NULL.\n\nIn this specific example, the results of Q1 and Q2 will be the same. However, if we modify the `countries` table to include a row with a NULL `Continent`, the results will differ.\n\nLet's add a row to the `countries` table:\n\n| CountryId | CountryName | Continent |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| 4         | France      | NULL      |  <-- This row has a NULL Continent\n\nNow, let's run Q1 and Q2 again.\n\nQ1 will not include the row with the NULL `Continent` in the count because the JOIN condition will fail for that row.\n\nQ2 will also not include the row with the NULL `Continent` in the count for the same reason.\n\nIn both cases, the row with the NULL `Continent` does not affect the count because it does not satisfy the JOIN condition. Therefore, the presence of a NULL `Continent` does not provide a counterexample.\n\nHowever, if we consider a LEFT JOIN instead of an INNER JOIN, the queries would not be equivalent because a LEFT JOIN would include rows from the left table (`continents`) even if the JOIN condition fails due to NULL values in the right table (`countries`). But since the queries as given both use an INNER JOIN, they will produce the same result set given the schema constraints (primary and foreign keys) that ensure `Continent` in `countries` and `ContId` in `continents` cannot be NULL.\n\nGiven the schema constraints and the nature of INNER JOIN, there is no modification to the example database that would cause Q1 and Q2 to produce different results.

In Q1, the `GROUP BY` clause only explicitly mentions `T1.Id`, while in Q2, it includes both `T1.Id` and `T1.FullName`.\n\nHowever, since `T1.Id` is a primary key for the `car_makers` table, `T1.FullName` is functionally dependent on `T1.Id`. This means that for each `T1.Id`, there is only one possible `T1.FullName`. Therefore, including `T1.FullName` in the `GROUP BY` clause does not change the grouping because it does not introduce any additional granularity to the grouping.\n\nIn SQL, when you group by a primary key, you can select other columns from the same table without needing to include them in the `GROUP BY` clause, as long as there is a functional dependency. This is because the SQL standard allows for \"functional dependency\" in the `GROUP BY` clause, which means that if one column in the `SELECT` list is functionally dependent on the grouped columns, it can be included without being explicitly listed in the `GROUP BY` clause.\n\nSince both queries will produce the same result set for any possible database that adheres to the given schema, they are semantically equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.FullName ,  T1.Id ,  count(*) FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN MODEL_LIST AS T2 ON T1.Id  =  T2.Maker GROUP BY T1.Id;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Id, T1.FullName, count(*) FROM car_makers AS T1 JOIN model_list AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.Maker GROUP BY T1.Id, T1.FullName```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The `LIMIT 1` will return the model with the lowest horsepower, which is \"Camaro\".\n\nQ2:\n```sql\nSELECT Model FROM model_list WHERE ModelId = ( SELECT Id FROM cars_data ORDER BY Horsepower ASC LIMIT 1 );\n```\nThis query will first find the `Id` of the car with the lowest `Horsepower` in the `cars_data` table, which is `2`. Then it will select the `Model` from `model_list` where `ModelId` is `2`, which is also \"Camaro\".\n\nIn this specific example, both queries return the same result, \"Camaro\".

However, Q2 will not be able to find a model with `ModelId = 2` in the `model_list` table because we changed the `ModelId` of \"Camaro\" to `3`. Therefore, Q2 will return no results or an error depending on the SQL database system's behavior when no match is found in a subquery used in a WHERE clause.\n\nThis demonstrates that the two queries are not equivalent because there exists at least one database instance where they produce different results.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Model FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId  =  T2.Id ORDER BY T2.horsepower ASC LIMIT 1;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Model FROM model_list WHERE ModelId = ( SELECT Id FROM cars_data ORDER BY Horsepower ASC LIMIT 1 );```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It directly correlates the `MakeId` with the `Id` of the car in `CARS_DATA` and orders the results by `horsepower` in ascending order, then limits the result to the first entry.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, is much more complex and involves several subqueries. It attempts to select the model from `model_list` where the `Maker` is in a list of `Id`s from `car_makers`. However, the subquery that selects from `car_makers` is based on a `Country` that is in turn selected from `countries` where the `CountryName` is equal to the lowest `Horsepower` from `cars_data`. This is a logical error because `CountryName` is expected to be a textual country name, not a numeric horsepower value.\n\nTo illustrate the non-equivalence with an example, consider the following database content:\n\n- `car_makers` has entries with `Id` values that correspond to different countries.\n- `countries` has `CountryId` and `CountryName` that do not match any numeric `Horsepower` value.\n- `cars_data` has `Id` and `Horsepower` values for different cars.\n- `model_list` and `car_names` have `Model` entries that correspond to the `Maker` and `MakeId` respectively.\n\nIn this scenario, Q1 would successfully return the model with the lowest horsepower, while Q2 would fail to return any model because the subquery looking for `CountryName` equal to a `Horsepower` value would not find any matching country (since `CountryName` is not numeric).\n\nTherefore, since there exists a database configuration where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 would not be identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Model FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId  =  T2.Id ORDER BY T2.horsepower ASC LIMIT 1;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT model FROM model_list WHERE Maker IN (SELECT Id FROM car_makers WHERE Country IN (SELECT CountryId FROM countries WHERE CountryName = (SELECT Horsepower FROM cars_data ORDER BY Horsepower ASC LIMIT 1)));```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

This difference can lead to different results if the `model` column in `MODEL_LIST` does not always match the `MakeId` column in `CAR_NAMES`.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider the following data:\n\n`car_makers` table:\n```\nId | Maker\n---------\n1  | Ford\n2  | Toyota\n```\n\n`model_list` table:\n```\nModelId | Maker | Model\n-----------------------\n1       | 1     | Mustang\n2       | 2     | Corolla\n```\n\n`car_names` table:\n```\nMakeId | Model   | Make\n-----------------------\n1      | Mustang | Ford\n2      | Corolla | Toyota\n```\n\n`cars_data` table:\n```\nId | Year\n---------\n1  | 1970\n2  | 1970\n```\n\nIn this example, the `model` column in `model_list` matches the `Model` column in `car_names`, and the `ModelId` column in `model_list` matches the `MakeId` column in `car_names`.

This would cause Q1 to return results, but Q2 would not return any results because the join condition `T2.ModelId = T3.MakeId` would not be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent because there exists a database instance where they would produce different results.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT DISTINCT T1.Maker FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN MODEL_LIST AS T2 ON T1.Id  =  T2.Maker JOIN CAR_NAMES AS T3 ON T2.model  =  T3.model JOIN CARS_DATA AS T4 ON T3.MakeId  =  T4.id WHERE T4.year  =  '1970';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT DISTINCT T1.Maker FROM car_makers AS T1 JOIN model_list AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.Maker JOIN car_names AS T3 ON T2.ModelId = T3.MakeId JOIN cars_data AS T4 ON T3.MakeId = T4.Id WHERE T4.Year = 1970```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Q1 filters based on the country name being 'usa', while Q2 filters based on the continent being 'USA'. These are two different attributes and can lead to different results.\n\nFor example, if there is a country named 'usa' in a continent other than the one with the continent name 'USA', Q1 would count models from that country, but Q2 would not, because it is looking for models from the continent 'USA', not the country 'usa'.\n\nHere is a counter example that would produce different results for Q1 and Q2:\n\nLet's say we have the following data:\n\nTable continents:\n| ContId | Continent |\n|--------|-----------|\n| 1      | North America |\n| 2      | USA         |\n\nTable countries:\n| CountryId | CountryName | Continent |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| 1         | usa         | 1         |\n| 2         | canada      | 1         |\n\nTable car_makers:\n| Id | Maker | FullName | Country |\n|----|-------|----------|---------|\n| 1  | Ford  | Ford Motor Company | 1 |\n| 2  | GM    | General Motors | 2 |\n\nTable model_list:\n| ModelId | Maker | Model |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| 1       | 1     | Mustang |\n| 2       | 2     | Camaro |\n\nNow, when we run Q1, it will count the models made by car makers from the country 'usa', which is Ford Mustang. So the count will be 1.\n\nWhen we run Q2, it will count the models made by car makers from the continent 'USA', but there are no car makers associated with the continent 'USA' in our data, so the count will be 0.\n\nTherefore, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, and the queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) FROM MODEL_LIST AS T1 JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T2 ON T1.Maker  =  T2.Id JOIN COUNTRIES AS T3 ON T2.Country  =  T3.CountryId WHERE T3.CountryName  =  'usa';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT count(*) FROM model_list AS ml JOIN car_makers AS cm ON ml.Maker = cm.Id JOIN countries AS c ON cm.Country = c.CountryId JOIN continents as cnt ON c.Continent = cnt.ContId WHERE cnt.Continent = 'USA';```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

So, for France, it will count 4.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will count the number of distinct `car_makers.Id` values, which, for France, is only 3 because it will not count the repeated Id for Alpha twice.\n\nTherefore, Q1 will include France in its result set (since it counts 4 makers, which is greater than or equal to 3), but Q2 will not include France in its result set (since it counts only 3 distinct makers).\n\nThis counterexample shows that the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.CountryName FROM COUNTRIES AS T1 JOIN CONTINENTS AS T2 ON T1.Continent  =  T2.ContId JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T3 ON T1.CountryId  =  T3.Country WHERE T2.Continent  =  'europe' GROUP BY T1.CountryName HAVING count(*)  >=  3;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT countries.CountryName FROM countries JOIN continents ON countries.Continent = continents.ContId JOIN car_makers ON countries.CountryId = car_makers.Country WHERE continents.Continent = 'Europe' GROUP BY countries.CountryName HAVING count(car_makers.Id) >= 3```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

This query will return no rows because there is no match for 'volvo' in the Model column of CAR_NAMES.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, selects the average engine displacement (Edispl) from the CARS_DATA table for cars that have a MakeId corresponding to a Maker of 'volvo' in the CAR_MAKERS table. This query correctly traverses the relationships between tables to filter the cars made by 'volvo'.\n\nGiven the example database, Q1 will return NULL or no result because there is no match for the condition `Model = 'volvo'` in the CAR_NAMES table. Q2 will return the average of 2.3 and 2.5, which is 2.4, because it correctly identifies the cars made by 'volvo' and calculates the average displacement.\n\nSince Q1 and Q2 produce different results for this example database, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT avg(T2.edispl) FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1.MakeId  =  T2.Id WHERE T1.Model  =  'volvo';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT avg(Edispl) FROM cars_data WHERE Id IN (SELECT MakeId FROM car_names WHERE Model IN (SELECT Model FROM model_list WHERE Maker IN (SELECT Id FROM car_makers WHERE Maker = 'volvo')))```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In Q1, the average is calculated over the column `edispl` from the `CARS_DATA` table (aliased as T2), while in Q2, the average is calculated over the column `Edispl` from the `cars_data` table (aliased as T1). The difference in capitalization of the column name (`edispl` vs `Edispl`) suggests a potential case sensitivity issue in the SQL database.\n\nIf the SQL database is case-insensitive, then the two queries would be equivalent because they would be referring to the same column. However, if the database is case-sensitive, the two queries would not be equivalent because they would be referring to different columns (assuming both `edispl` and `Edispl` exist as separate columns in the `cars_data` table).\n\nTo demonstrate the non-equivalence with a counterexample, consider a database where the `cars_data` table has two separate columns, one named `edispl` and another named `Edispl`, with different data in each column.

The key difference between the two queries is how they join the tables and the columns they use for filtering.\n\nLet's look at the joins and conditions in both queries:\n\nQ1 joins `MODEL_LIST` with `CAR_NAMES` on `Model`, then `CAR_NAMES` with `CARS_DATA` on `MakeId`, and finally `MODEL_LIST` with `CAR_MAKERS` on `Maker`.

In Q1, `CAR_NAMES.MakeId` is used to join with `CARS_DATA.Id`, while in Q2, `model_list.ModelId` is used to join with `cars_data.Id`.

Then it will join `car_names` (T2) with `cars_data` (T3) on `MakeId`, which will only work for Camaro since Mustang's weight is 3600. Finally, it will join `model_list` (T1) with `car_makers` (T4) on `Maker`, and filter out Ford Motor Company.

Then it will join `model_list` (T3) with `cars_data` (T1) on `ModelId`, which will only work for Camaro since Mustang's weight is 3600. However, the filter on `car_makers.Maker` is incorrect because it should be `car_makers.FullName`.

The `NOT IN` subquery in Q2 will return unexpected results if there is a NULL value in the `Country` column of the `car_makers` table.\n\nHere's why:\n\nQ1 uses the `EXCEPT` operator, which will exclude all countries that have a matching `CountryId` in the `car_makers` table. It does not matter if there are NULL values in the `Country` column of `car_makers`; the `EXCEPT` operator will simply ignore those.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, uses a `NOT IN` subquery. If there is a NULL value in the `Country` column of the `car_makers` table, the entire `NOT IN` subquery will evaluate to unknown for any country, and as a result, the `WHERE` clause will filter out all countries, even those that do not have a matching `CountryId` in the `car_makers` table.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, let's modify the example database such that the `car_makers` table contains a NULL value in the `Country` column:\n\n```\ncountries\n+-----------+-------------+\n| CountryId | CountryName |\n+-----------+-------------+\n|         1 | CountryA    |\n|         2 | CountryB    |\n+-----------+-------------+\n\ncar_makers\n+----+-------+----------+---------+\n| Id | Maker | FullName | Country |\n+----+-------+----------+---------+\n|  1 | Maker1| Full1    |       1 |\n|  2 | Maker2| Full2    |    NULL |\n+----+-------+----------+---------+\n```\n\nFor this database, Q1 will return:\n\n```\n+-------------+\n| CountryName |\n+-------------+\n| CountryB    |\n+-------------+\n```\n\nQ2 will return an empty set because the presence of NULL in the subquery causes the `NOT IN` condition to fail for all rows.\n\nSince we can create a scenario where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT CountryName FROM countries EXCEPT SELECT T1.CountryName FROM countries AS T1 JOIN CAR_MAKERS AS T2 ON T1.countryId  =  T2.Country;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT CountryName FROM countries WHERE CountryId NOT IN (SELECT Country FROM car_makers)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, for the second part of Q1, neither Ford nor GM has more than three car names associated with their models (they both have exactly two), so Q1 will return an empty set.\n\nFor Q2, the second part is looking at the count of entries in the `car_makers` table, which is unrelated to the number of models or car names. Since there are only two entries in `car_makers` (Ford and GM), neither satisfies the condition of having more than three entries. Therefore, Q2 will also return an empty set.\n\nHowever, if we modify the database such that there are more than three entries for a car maker in the `car_makers` table (which is not realistic according to the schema, but let's assume for the sake of argument), Q2 could potentially return results while Q1 would still return an empty set.\n\nFor example, if we add another entry for GM in the `car_makers` table:\n\ncar_makers (modified):\n| Id | Maker | FullName | Country |\n|----|-------|----------|---------|\n| 1  | Ford  | Ford Inc | USA     |\n| 2  | GM    | GM Corp  | USA     |\n| 3  | GM    | GM Corp  | USA     |\n| 4  | GM    | GM Corp  | USA     |\n| 5  | GM    | GM Corp  | USA     |\n\nNow, Q2 would return GM because it has more than three entries in the `car_makers` table, while Q1 would still return an empty set because the number of car names associated with GM's models has not changed.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Q1 and Q2 are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```select t1.id ,  t1.maker from car_makers as t1 join model_list as t2 on t1.id  =  t2.maker group by t1.id having count(*)  >=  2 intersect select t1.id ,  t1.maker from car_makers as t1 join model_list as t2 on t1.id  =  t2.maker join car_names as t3 on t2.model  =  t3.model group by t1.id having count(*)  >  3;```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Id, T1.Maker FROM car_makers AS T1 JOIN model_list AS T2 ON T1.Id = T2.Maker GROUP BY T1.Id HAVING count(T2.Model) >= 2 INTERSECT SELECT T1.Id, T1.Maker FROM car_makers AS T1 GROUP BY T1.Maker HAVING count(*) > 3```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

The results will be grouped by countryid, and since both conditions are met for different countries, both countries will appear in the result set.\n\nQ2 will select CountryA for the same reason as Q1. However, for the second part of the OR condition, it will also select CountryB because it has a car maker that makes the 'fiat' model. The results are not grouped by countryid, so if a country satisfies both conditions, it could potentially appear twice in the result set.\n\nHowever, in this particular example, both queries will still yield the same result because each country satisfies only one of the conditions. To create a counterexample, we need a situation where a country satisfies both conditions and appears twice in the result set for Q2 but only once in the result set for Q1 due to the grouping.\n\nLet's modify the database to create such a situation:\n\nTable: car_makers (modified)\n| Id | Maker | FullName | Country |\n|----|-------|----------|---------|\n| 1  | A     | MakerA   | 1       |\n| 2  | B     | MakerB   | 1       |\n| 3  | C     | MakerC   | 1       |\n| 4  | D     | MakerD   | 1       |\n| 5  | E     | MakerE   | 1       |  <-- Note: MakerE is now in CountryA\n\nTable: model_list (same as before)\n| ModelId | Maker | Model  |\n|---------|-------|--------|\n| 1       | 5     | fiat   |\n\nNow, CountryA (CountryId = 1) has more than 3 car makers and also has a maker that makes the 'fiat' model.\n\nQ1 will still only include CountryA once in the result set because of the GROUP BY clause.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will include CountryA twice in the result set because it satisfies both conditions of the OR clause and there is no GROUP BY to combine the results.\n\nSince Q1 and Q2 produce different results with this modified database, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```select t1.countryid ,  t1.countryname from countries as t1 join car_makers as t2 on t1.countryid  =  t2.country group by t1.countryid having count(*)  >  3 union select t1.countryid ,  t1.countryname from countries as t1 join car_makers as t2 on t1.countryid  =  t2.country join model_list as t3 on t2.id  =  t3.maker where t3.model  =  'fiat';```\n\nQ2:```SELECT CountryId, CountryName FROM countries WHERE CountryId IN (SELECT Country FROM car_makers GROUP BY Country HAVING count(*) > 3) OR CountryId IN (SELECT Country FROM car_makers WHERE Id IN (SELECT Maker FROM model_list WHERE Model = 'fiat'))```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

This ensures that only flights with a destination of \"Aberdeen\" and operated by \"United Airlines\" are considered.\n- The subqueries in Q2 are correlated subqueries that effectively perform the same filtering as the JOINs in Q1.

In Q1, the GROUP BY clause is using `T1.Airline`, which is not a column in the provided schema for the `airlines` table. The correct column, as used in the JOIN condition, should be `T1.uid`. This mistake would cause Q1 to fail during execution because `T1.Airline` does not exist.\n\nHowever, even if we assume that `T1.Airline` was a typo and it should be `T1.uid`, the queries would still not be equivalent. The reason is that the GROUP BY clause in Q1 and Q2 groups by different columns. Q1 groups by `T1.uid` (assuming the typo is corrected), while Q2 groups by `T2.Airline`. If `T1.uid` and `T2.Airline` always have a one-to-one relationship, the queries could be considered equivalent. But if there are cases where multiple `uid` values in the `airlines` table correspond to the same `Airline` value in the `flights` table, the results could differ.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, consider the following data:\n\nairlines table:\n| uid | Airline | Abbreviation | Country |\n|-----|---------|--------------|---------|\n| 1   | AA      | AA           | USA     |\n| 2   | AA      | AA2          | USA     |\n\nflights table:\n| Airline | FlightNo | SourceAirport | DestAirport |\n|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|\n| AA      | F1       | S1            | D1          |\n| AA      | F2       | S2            | D2          |\n\nIn this case, the `airlines` table has two different `uid` values for the same `Airline` value. If we correct the typo in Q1 and run both queries, they would produce different results because Q1 would group by `uid` and Q2 would group by `Airline`. Q1 could potentially return either of the two `uid` values (1 or 2), while Q2 would group all flights under the same `Airline` value and return a single row.\n\nTherefore, the queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Abbreviation ,  T1.Country FROM AIRLINES AS T1 JOIN FLIGHTS AS T2 ON T1.uid  =  T2.Airline GROUP BY T1.Airline ORDER BY count(*) LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Abbreviation, T1.Country FROM airlines AS T1 JOIN flights AS T2 ON T1.uid = T2.Airline GROUP BY T2.Airline ORDER BY count(*) ASC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In Q1, the GROUP BY clause is using `T1.Airline`, which is incorrect because the `airlines` table does not have a column named `Airline`. This is likely a typo and should be `T1.uid`. If we correct this typo, the GROUP BY clause in Q1 would be `T1.uid` and in Q2 it is `F.Airline`.\n\nEven with the corrected typo, the queries are still not equivalent. The reason is that the GROUP BY clause in Q1 groups by `T1.uid` (which is the unique identifier for airlines), while Q2 groups by `F.Airline` (which is the foreign key in the `flights` table referencing `airlines.uid`). Although these two fields are related, the SQL standard does not guarantee that grouping by a primary key or its corresponding foreign key will produce the same grouping sets if there are duplicate entries in the joined tables.\n\nHere's a counterexample to show that the outputs can be different:\n\nLet's assume we have the following data:\n\nairlines table:\n| uid | Airline | Abbreviation | Country |\n|-----|---------|--------------|---------|\n| 1   | AA      | American     | USA     |\n| 2   | BA      | British      | UK      |\n\nflights table:\n| Airline | FlightNo | SourceAirport | DestAirport |\n|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|\n| 1       | F100     | JFK           | LHR         |\n| 1       | F101     | JFK           | LHR         |\n| 2       | F200     | LHR           | JFK         |\n\nIf we run Q1 (with the corrected GROUP BY `T1.uid`), it will group by the `uid` of the airlines and count the number of flights for each airline. Since `AA` has two flights and `BA` has one, `AA` will be the result with the lowest count after the LIMIT 1.\n\nIf we run Q2, it will also group by the `Airline` (which is the same as `uid` in this case) and count the number of flights for each airline. The result should be the same as Q1 in this particular example.\n\nHowever, if there is a discrepancy between the `uid` and `Airline` due to a data entry error or some other anomaly, the results could differ. For example, if there is a row in the `flights` table with an `Airline` value that does not correspond to any `uid` in the `airlines` table, Q2 might group that row separately, while Q1 would not include it at all because of the JOIN condition.\n\nTherefore, while the queries may produce the same result under normal circumstances, they are not guaranteed to be equivalent for all possible databases, and a counterexample can be constructed where the outputs are not identical.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.Abbreviation ,  T1.Country FROM AIRLINES AS T1 JOIN FLIGHTS AS T2 ON T1.uid  =  T2.Airline GROUP BY T1.Airline ORDER BY count(*) LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT A.Abbreviation, A.Country FROM airlines AS A JOIN flights AS F ON A.uid = F.Airline GROUP BY F.Airline ORDER BY count(*) LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Q2 is directly filtering the FLIGHTS table on the SourceAirport column with the value \"Aberdeen\".\n\nHere's how you can modify the example database such that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical:\n\nLet's say the AIRPORTS table has the following entry:\n```\nCity         | AirportCode | AirportName | Country | CountryAbbrev\n-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------------\nAberdeen     | ABZ         | Aberdeen    | UK      | GB\n```\n\nAnd the FLIGHTS table has the following entries:\n```\nAirline | FlightNo | SourceAirport | DestAirport\n--------|----------|---------------|------------\nBA      | BA123    | ABZ           | LHR\nAA      | AA456    | Aberdeen      | JFK\n```\n\nFor Q1, the query would join FLIGHTS with AIRPORTS on the SourceAirport matching the AirportCode and then filter where the city is \"Aberdeen\".

This would return the flight AA456 because it matches the SourceAirport \"Aberdeen\".\n\nAs you can see, the results are different because the SourceAirport in the FLIGHTS table can contain either the AirportCode or the city name, and the two queries are filtering based on different criteria.

In such a case, the `GROUP BY` clause will behave differently in each query.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nLet's say we have the following data in the `employee` table:\n\n```\nEmployee_ID | Name\n------------|-----\n1           | Alice\n2           | Bob\n```\n\nAnd the following data in the `evaluation` table:\n\n```\nEmployee_ID | Year_awarded | Bonus\n------------|--------------|------\n1           | 2020         | 1000\n1           | 2021         | 1500\n2           | 2020         | 1000\n2           | 2021         | 1500\n```\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have the same number of evaluations (2 each), which is the highest count.\n\nNow, let's look at the queries:\n\nQ1 groups by `t2.Employee_ID` and orders by the count of evaluations. Since both Alice and Bob have the same number of evaluations, the `LIMIT 1` could return either Alice or Bob, depending on how the SQL engine resolves ties.\n\nQ2 groups by `T1.Name` and orders by the count of evaluations. Similar to Q1, it could return either Alice or Bob, but the choice of which name to return is not guaranteed to be the same as in Q1 because the grouping is done by a different column (`Name` instead of `Employee_ID`).\n\nTherefore, depending on the SQL engine's tie-breaking behavior for `ORDER BY ...

Here's how:\n\nConsider a database with the following data:\n\nTable `shop`:\n```\nShop_ID | Name   | Location | District | Number_products | Manager_name\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1       | ShopA  | Loc1     | Dist1    | 100             | Alice\n2       | ShopB  | Loc2     | Dist2    | 150             | Bob\n```\n\nTable `hiring`:\n```\nShop_ID | Employee_ID | Start_from | Is_full_time\n-------------------------------------------------\n1       | 101         | 2020-01-01 | 1\n1       | 102         | 2020-02-01 | 1\n2       | 103         | 2020-03-01 | 1\n```\n\nNow, let's look at the output of Q1 and Q2:\n\nQ1:\n```\ncount(*) | name\n----------------\n2        | ShopA\n1        | ShopB\n```\n\nQ2:\n```\nName   | count(*)\n----------------\nShopA  | 2\nShopB  | 1\n```\n\nAt first glance, the outputs seem identical. However, let's modify the `shop` table by adding a new shop without any hiring records:\n\nTable `shop` (modified):\n```\nShop_ID | Name   | Location | District | Number_products | Manager_name\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1       | ShopA  | Loc1     | Dist1    | 100             | Alice\n2       | ShopB  | Loc2     | Dist2    | 150             | Bob\n3       | ShopC  | Loc3     | Dist3    | 200             | Charlie\n```\n\nNow, let's run the queries again:\n\nQ1:\n```\ncount(*) | name\n----------------\n2        | ShopA\n1        | ShopB\n```\n\nQ2:\n```\nName   | count(*)\n----------------\nShopA  | 2\nShopB  | 1\n```\n\nThe output of Q1 remains the same because it groups by `t2.name`, which only includes shops that have corresponding records in the `hiring` table. However, Q2 groups by `shop.Shop_ID`, and if the SQL engine allows grouping by a column that is not in the SELECT list (which is not standard SQL but may be allowed by some databases), it could potentially include ShopC with a count of 0 in the results, which would make the output different from Q1.\n\nSince there is a possibility of a different output based on the database's handling of grouping by a column not in the SELECT list, the two queries are not guaranteed to be equivalent in all cases.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) ,  t2.name FROM hiring AS t1 JOIN shop AS t2 ON t1.shop_id  =  t2.shop_id GROUP BY t2.name```\n\nQ2:```SELECT shop.Name , count(*) FROM hiring JOIN shop ON hiring.Shop_ID = shop.Shop_ID GROUP BY shop.Shop_ID```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It will order the results by the count of documents for each template_id in descending order and limit the result to 1. This means it will return the template_id from the Documents table that has the most documents associated with it.\n\nQ2 will join Templates with Documents on Template_ID and then group by T1.Template_ID (which is Templates.Template_ID). It will order the results by the count of documents for each Template_ID in descending order and limit the result to 1. This means it will return the Template_ID from the Templates table that has the most documents associated with it.\n\nIn our example database, both template_id 1 and 2 are used in the Documents table, but template_id 1 is used twice. Therefore, both Q1 and Q2 will return the same template_id (1) as the most used template_id. However, the difference lies in the Template_Type_Code that is returned.\n\nQ1 will return the Template_Type_Code from the Templates table, while Q2 will return the Template_Type_Code from the Templates table as well. In this example, since there is a direct match between the template_id and Template_Type_Code in both tables, the output will be the same.\n\nHowever, if we modify the Templates table to have a different Template_Type_Code for the same Template_ID, the outputs will differ. For example:\n\nModified Templates Table:\n| Template_ID | Version_Number | Template_Type_Code | Date_Effective_From | Date_Effective_To | Template_Details |\n|-------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| 1           | 1              | C                  | 2021-01-01          | NULL              | Template A1      |\n| 2           | 1              | B                  | 2021-01-02          | NULL              | Template B1      |\n\nNow, Q1 will still return template_id 1, but with Template_Type_Code 'C', while Q2 will return template_id 1 with Template_Type_Code 'A' (assuming the original Template_Type_Code for template_id 1 was 'A' in the Documents table).

It will count the number of documents for each template and order the results by this count in descending order, then limit the results to 1.\n\nQ2 will do the same but will start by joining Templates with Documents on `Template_ID`. It will also group by `T1.Template_ID`, count the number of documents for each template, order by this count in descending order, and limit the results to 1.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like they should produce the same result. However, the difference lies in the columns they are selecting. Q1 selects `T1.template_id` and `T2.Template_Type_Code`, whereas Q2 selects `T1.Template_ID` and `T1.Template_Type_Code`.\n\nIf the `Templates` table has multiple versions of the same `Template_ID` with different `Template_Type_Code`, the queries could produce different results because Q1 could potentially group by `template_id` and select a `Template_Type_Code` that is not the most frequent one (since it's joining on `Documents` first), while Q2 will always select the `Template_Type_Code` that corresponds to the `Template_ID` in the `Templates` table.\n\nHere's a modified example that will produce different results for Q1 and Q2:\n\n```\nTemplates Table:\n+------------+-----------------+------------------+\n| Template_ID | Version_Number | Template_Type_Code |\n+------------+-----------------+------------------+\n|          1 |               1 |                A |\n|          1 |               2 |                B |\n|          2 |               1 |                C |\n+------------+-----------------+------------------+\n\nDocuments Table:\n+-------------+------------+-------------------+\n| Document_ID | Template_ID | Document_Name     |\n+-------------+------------+-------------------+\n|           1 |          1 | Document1         |\n|           2 |          1 | Document2         |\n|           3 |          2 | Document3         |\n+-------------+------------+-------------------+\n```\n\nIn this case, Q1 might return `Template_ID` 1 with `Template_Type_Code` A or B, depending on which `Template_ID` and `Template_Type_Code` pair it encounters first in the join.

The first query (Q1) is looking for paragraphs where the `paragraph_text` exactly equals 'korea', without any characters before or after the word. This means it will not match any text that contains 'korea' with additional characters or even different casing (like 'Korea', 'korean', etc.).\n\nThe second query (Q2) uses the wildcard character '%' before and after 'Korea', which means it will match any `paragraph_text` that contains the word 'Korea' anywhere in the text, regardless of what characters come before or after it. Additionally, it is case-insensitive, assuming the database is set to a case-insensitive collation, which is common in many SQL databases.\n\nTo demonstrate the non-equivalence, consider the following example database:\n\n```\nParagraphs\n+--------------+-------------+-------------------+---------------+\n| Paragraph_ID | Document_ID | Paragraph_Text    | Other_Details |\n+--------------+-------------+-------------------+---------------+\n| 1            | 1           | korea             | Detail1       |\n| 2            | 1           | South Korea       | Detail2       |\n| 3            | 2           | The history of korea | Detail3    |\n| 4            | 2           | Korean culture    | Detail4       |\n+--------------+-------------+-------------------+---------------+\n```\n\nFor this example database, Q1 would return:\n\n```\n+---------------+\n| other_details |\n+---------------+\n| Detail1       |\n+---------------+\n```\n\nQ2 would return:\n\n```\n+---------------+\n| Other_Details |\n+---------------+\n| Detail1       |\n| Detail2       |\n| Detail3       |\n+---------------+\n```\n\nAs you can see, the outputs are not identical because Q2 matches more rows than Q1 due to the use of wildcards and potential case insensitivity.

Q1 groups by `T1.document_id`, which is from the `Paragraphs` table, while Q2 groups by `T1.Document_ID`, which is from the `Documents` table. The SQL standard requires that all non-aggregated columns in the `SELECT` clause must be included in the `GROUP BY` clause. Since the two queries group by different columns, they could potentially yield different results if there are more columns selected or if the database is structured differently.\n\nFor example, if the `Documents` table had duplicate `Document_ID` values with different `Document_Name` values (which would violate the primary key constraint, but for the sake of argument), the two queries could yield different results because they are grouping by columns from different tables. Since the primary key constraint ensures that `Document_ID` is unique in the `Documents` table, this specific scenario cannot occur in a properly structured database following the given schema.\n\nHowever, the fact that the two queries group by different columns from different tables means that they are not guaranteed to be equivalent in all scenarios, even though they produce the same result in the given examples.

It will count the number of paragraphs per document and order the results by this count in descending order. Since Document 1 has two paragraphs, it will be at the top of the list. The query will then limit the results to 1, so it will return the `document_id` and `document_name` of Document 1.\n\nQ2 will join Documents with Paragraphs and then group by `T1.Document_ID`. Similar to Q1, it will count the number of paragraphs per document and order the results by this count in descending order. Since Document 1 has two paragraphs, it will also be at the top of the list. The query will then limit the results to 1, so it will return the `Document_ID` and `Document_Name` of Document 1.\n\nIn this example, both queries will return the same result. However, if we modify the database such that the `Document_Name` is not unique, we can create a situation where the two queries will not return the same result.\n\nConsider the following modification to the Documents table:\n\n```\nDocuments Table:\n+-------------+------------+---------------+\n| Document_ID | Template_ID | Document_Name |\n+-------------+------------+---------------+\n|           1 |          1  | Doc           |\n|           2 |          2  | Doc           |\n+-------------+------------+---------------+\n```\n\nNow both documents have the same name \"Doc\". If we run Q1 and Q2, they will still return the same `document_id` (since it is unique), but the `document_name` they return could be different because the `GROUP BY` clause does not guarantee which `document_name` will be returned when there are duplicates within the group. This is because SQL standard does not define which row's non-grouped columns will be used in the result when the query includes non-aggregated columns that are not part of the `GROUP BY` clause.\n\nTherefore, since there is a possibility that Q1 and Q2 could return different results with a modified database, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.document_id ,  T2.document_name FROM Paragraphs AS T1 JOIN Documents AS T2 ON T1.document_id  =  T2.document_id GROUP BY T1.document_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.Document_ID , T1.Document_Name FROM Documents AS T1 JOIN Paragraphs AS T2 ON T1.Document_ID = T2.Document_ID GROUP BY T1.Document_ID ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In Q1, the Age column is compared to integer literals (32 and 33), while in Q2, the Age column is compared to string literals ('32' and '33').\n\nIf the Age column is defined as an integer data type, both queries will typically yield the same result because SQL will automatically convert the string literals to integers for the comparison.\n\nHowever, if the Age column is defined as a string or varchar data type, the two queries may yield different results.

However, Q2 would return 'Charlie' because the comparison `Age = '32'` would succeed as the string literals match exactly.\n\nTherefore, since there exists a possible database schema and data that would cause Q1 and Q2 to yield different results, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT Name FROM teacher WHERE Age  =  32 OR Age  =  33```\n\nQ2:```SELECT Name FROM teacher WHERE Age = '32' OR Age = '33'```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

In Q1, the `visitor` table is aliased as `t1` and the `visit` table as `t2`, while in Q2, the `visitor` table is aliased as `T2` and the `visit` table as `T1`. However, this difference in aliasing does not affect the output of the queries because the aliases are consistently used within each query.\n\nGiven that the structure and logic of the queries are the same, and assuming that the `GROUP BY` clause is correctly used with the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses (which is the case here), the two queries should be semantically equivalent.\n\nTo confirm this, let's consider an example database:\n\nvisitor table:\n| ID | Name | Level_of_membership | Age |\n|----|------|---------------------|-----|\n| 1  | John | Gold                | 30  |\n| 2  | Jane | Silver              | 25  |\n\nvisit table:\n| Museum_ID | visitor_ID | Num_of_Ticket | Total_spent |\n|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------|\n| 10        | 1          | 2             | 100         |\n| 20        | 2          | 1             | 150         |\n\nRunning both Q1 and Q2 on this example database would yield the same result, which would be the visitor with the highest total spent. In this case, it would be Jane with a `Total_spent` of 150.\n\nSince the queries are equivalent in this example, let's consider if there is a way to modify the example database such that the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical. However, given the structure of the queries and the fact that they are both performing the same operations on the same columns, there is no modification to the database that would cause the outputs to differ. The `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the aggregation (`SUM`) is done per visitor, and the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses ensure that the top spender is selected.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are semantically equivalent, and we cannot find a counterexample where the outputs would not be identical.\n\nTHE ANSWER IS EQUIVALENT", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT t2.visitor_id ,  t1.name ,  t1.Level_of_membership FROM visitor AS t1 JOIN visit AS t2 ON t1.id  =  t2.visitor_id GROUP BY t2.visitor_id ORDER BY sum(t2.Total_spent) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T2.ID, T2.Name, T2.Level_of_membership FROM visitor AS T2 JOIN visit AS T1 ON T2.ID = T1.visitor_ID GROUP BY T2.ID ORDER BY SUM(T1.Total_spent) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, since the 'matches' table does not include a 'winner_name' column in the provided schema, this query is actually invalid.

However, the difference lies in the fact that Q1 assumes that 'winner_name' is a single column containing the full name, while Q2 constructs the full name from two separate columns 'first_name' and 'last_name'.

However, in standard SQL, single quotes are typically used for string literals, and double quotes are used to identify database objects like table and column names.\n\nSince the queries are otherwise identical, they will yield the same result set for any given database that adheres to the standard SQL quoting conventions.

Since it does not group by player_id, it will consider all entries in the rankings table. If there are multiple entries for a player, it will pick the one with the highest 'tours' value. In this case, it will pick the entry for Alice with 21 tours.\n\nQ2 will group the results by player_id, summing the 'tours' for each player. It will then order the results by this sum in descending order. In this case, it will sum the tours for Alice (20 + 21) and for Bob (15 + 16), and then order the results.\n\nThe output of Q1 will be:\n| country_code | first_name |\n|--------------|------------|\n| USA          | Alice      |\n\nThe output of Q2 will be:\n| first_name | country_code |\n|------------|--------------|\n| Alice      | USA          |\n\nAlthough the outputs look similar at first glance, the underlying logic is different.

The ORDER BY clause does not guarantee a deterministic order in the case of ties unless additional columns are specified for tie-breaking.\n\nHowever, Q2 will still return the details of a single player, which is the one with the winner_id that appears first in the subquery's result set when ordered by winner_rank_points. This could be either player 1 or player 2, depending on the database engine's handling of the LIMIT clause in the subquery.\n\nSince the two queries can produce different results depending on how the database engine handles ties and the order of rows, they are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.first_name ,  T1.country_code ,  T1.birth_date FROM players AS T1 JOIN matches AS T2 ON T1.player_id  =  T2.winner_id ORDER BY T2.winner_rank_points DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT first_name, country_code, birth_date FROM players WHERE player_id = (SELECT winner_id FROM matches ORDER BY winner_rank_points DESC LIMIT 1)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It will return \"Commerce\" because it has the most enrolments.\n\nRunning Q2 will group by `degree_program_id` and order by the count of enrolments in each program, selecting the top result. However, since it groups by `degree_program_id`, it is possible that if there are multiple `degree_summary_name` entries with the same `degree_program_id`, it could potentially return a different `degree_summary_name` than Q1. But in this schema, `degree_program_id` is a primary key, so there should be a one-to-one relationship between `degree_program_id` and `degree_summary_name`.\n\nHowever, the difference lies in the fact that Q1 explicitly groups by `degree_summary_name`, while Q2 groups by `degree_program_id`. If there were a case where `degree_summary_name` is not unique for each `degree_program_id`, which is not possible in this schema due to the primary key constraint, the results could differ. But given the schema constraints, the results will be the same for this particular schema.\n\nDespite the schema constraints, the queries are not equivalent in a general sense because they group by different columns.

Student_Enrolment AS T2\nON T1.degree_program_id = T2.degree_program_id\nGROUP BY T1.degree_summary_name\nORDER BY count(*) DESC\nLIMIT 1\n```\nThis query will return \"Science\" because it is the

that there are two degree programs with the same highest count of enrolments but different degree_summary_names, the queries may produce different results.\n\nLet's modify the Student_Enrolment table:\n\nStudent_Enrolment (modified)\n| student_enrolment_id | degree_program_id | student_id |\n|----------------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1                    | 1

This could happen if a student is enrolled in a course but has not yet received a transcript entry for that course.\n\nFor example, let's say we have the following data:\n\n`Student_Enrolment_Courses` table:\n| student_course_id | course_id | student_enrolment_id |\n|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| 1                 | 101       | 201                  |\n| 2                 | 102       | 202                  |\n\n`Transcript_Contents` table:\n| student_course_id | transcript_id |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| 1                 | 301           |\n\nIn this case, `student_course_id` 2 exists in `Student_Enrolment_Courses` but not in `Transcript_Contents`.\n\nNow, let's look at the queries:\n\nQ1 will only consider the `Transcript_Contents` table and will return the count of transcript entries grouped by `student_course_id`.

We have three students enrolled in these courses, and their `student_course_id` values are 101, 102, and 103. The `student_course_id` values 101 and 102 are associated with `course_id` 1, and the `student_course_id` value 103 is associated with `course_id` 2.\n\nNow, let's say we have the following entries in the `Transcript_Contents` table:\n- Two entries with `student_course_id` 101\n- One entry with `student_course_id` 102\n- Two entries with `student_course_id` 103\n\nThe `Student_Enrolment_Courses` table would look like this:\n- `student_course_id` 101, `course_id` 1\n- `student_course_id` 102, `course_id` 1\n- `student_course_id` 103, `course_id` 2\n\nNow, let's analyze the output of both queries:\n\nQ1 will count the number of transcript entries for each `student_course_id` and return the `student_course_id` with the highest count. In this case, both `student_course_id` 101 and 103 have the highest count of 2, but since we are using `LIMIT 1`, it will return just one of them (depending on how the database resolves the tie).\n\nQ2 will join the `Student_Enrolment_Courses` table with the `Transcript_Contents` table, count the number of transcript entries for each `course_id`, and return the `course_id` with the highest count along with its associated `student_course_id`. In this case, `course_id` 1 and 2 both have a total count of 3, but since we are grouping by `course_id`, it will return the `student_course_id` associated with the `course_id` that has the highest count. If there is a tie, it will return one of the `student_course_id` values associated with the winning `course_id` (again, depending on how the database resolves the tie).\n\nSince Q1 is only considering the count per `student_course_id` and Q2 is considering the count per `course_id`, the two queries can yield different results when there are multiple `student_course_id` values associated with the same `course_id`. In our example, Q1 could return either `student_course_id` 101 or 103, while Q2 would return a `student_course_id` associated with `course_id` 1 or 2, depending on which `student_course_id` is chosen in the case of a tie.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) ,  student_course_id FROM Transcript_Contents GROUP BY student_course_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.student_course_id, T1.course_id, COUNT(*) FROM Student_Enrolment_Courses AS T1 JOIN Transcript_Contents AS T2 ON T1.student_course_id = T2.student_course_id GROUP BY T1.course_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

demonstrate that the two queries are not equivalent, we can construct an example database where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 would differ.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n- There are two semesters, \"Semester 1\" and \"Semester 2\".\n- There are two degree programs, \"Master\" and \"Bachelor\".\n- There are two students, one enrolled in the \"Master\" program and the other in the \"Bachelor\" program.\n- Both students are enrolled in \"Semester 1\", but only the student in the \"Bachelor\" program is enrolled in \"Semester 2\".\n\nHere is how the relevant tables might look:\n\nSemesters

two queries:\n\nQ1 will return:\n- The distinct semester_id where a \"Master\" degree is enrolled, which is \"1\".\n- The distinct semester_id where a \"Bachelor\" degree is enrolled, which is \"1\" and \"2\".\n- The INTERSECT of the two will result in \"1\", since that is the only semester_id common to both \"Master\" and \"Bachelor\".\n\nQ2 will return:\n- The semester_name where a \"Master\" degree is enrolled, which is \"Semester 1\".\n- The semester_name where a \"Bachelor\" degree is enrolled, which is \"Semester 1\" and \"Semester 2\".\n- The INTERSECT of the two will result in \"Semester 1\", since that is the only semester_name common to both \"Master\" and \"Bachelor\".\n\nIn this example, Q1 returns a semester_id (1), while Q2 returns a semester_name (\"Semester 1\"). Since the types of the results are different (ID vs. name), the two queries cannot be equivalent.

The difference in the queries is the use of different quotation marks and case sensitivity in the column name.\n\nIn SQL, identifiers such as table names and column names can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive depending on the database system being used and its configuration.

In Q2, `\"Language\"` is quoted, which typically means that the identifier is case-sensitive. However, since the SQL standard dictates that identifiers are case-insensitive unless quoted, and assuming that the database schema follows the standard practices, `\"Language\"` should be interpreted in the same way as `LANGUAGE`.\n\nThe use of double quotes (`\"`) around `TV_Channel` in Q2 and the use of single quotes (`'`) around `English` in both queries are standard SQL syntax for quoting identifiers and string literals, respectively.

The only difference between the two queries is the order of the columns in the SELECT clause. However, the order of columns in the SELECT clause does not affect the results of the GROUP BY operation or the counts calculated.\n\nIn SQL, the GROUP BY clause is used to arrange identical data into groups with the aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), etc., applied to each group. The SELECT clause specifies the columns that you want to retrieve from the table. When using GROUP BY, the SELECT statement must contain only columns that are listed in the GROUP BY clause or columns that have an aggregate function applied to them.\n\nSince both queries are using the same GROUP BY clause and the same aggregate function (COUNT(*)), they will produce the same counts for each 'Directed_by' value. The only difference is the order in which the 'Directed_by' and the count are presented in the result set, but this does not affect the actual data or the equivalence of the queries.\n\nTherefore, no matter how the example database is modified, as long as the database schema remains the same, the outputs of Q1 and Q2 will always be identical.

The reason is that both queries are selecting the same columns from the same table with the same condition.

However, since the `GROUP BY` happens without the join, it will count each language once per country, regardless of how many times it appears in the `countrylanguage` table.\n\nIn the example database, \"Chinese\" is spoken in both AS1 and AS2, and \"English\" and \"Arabic\" are spoken in one country each. The count of \"Chinese\" would be 2, and the count of \"English\" and \"Arabic\" would be 1 each.\n\nFor Q1, the output would be \"Chinese\" because it is counted twice (once for each country it is associated with).\n\nFor Q2, the output would also be \"Chinese\", but for a different reason: it is the language with the highest count when considering unique country-language pairs.\n\nNow, let's modify the `countrylanguage` table to create a counterexample:\n\n```\nCountryCode | Language\n------------|---------\nAS1         | English\nAS1         | Chinese\nAS2         | Chinese\nAS2         | Chinese\n```\n\nIn this modified example, \"Chinese\" is listed twice for country AS2. This is an unrealistic scenario but serves to illustrate the point.\n\nFor Q1, the output would still be \"Chinese\" because it is counted three times (once for AS1 and twice for AS2).\n\nFor Q2, the output would also be \"Chinese\", but the count would only be 2 because the subquery only selects unique country codes, and the `GROUP BY` in the outer query does not count duplicates within the same country.\n\nSince we have found a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.Language FROM country AS T1 JOIN countrylanguage AS T2 ON T1.Code  =  T2.CountryCode WHERE T1.Continent  =  \"Asia\" GROUP BY T2.Language ORDER BY COUNT (*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT language FROM countrylanguage WHERE CountryCode IN (SELECT Code FROM country WHERE Continent = 'Asia') GROUP BY Language ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Since Q1 checks for the country name not being in the subquery result, it could potentially exclude the same country multiple times (which doesn't have an actual effect beyond excluding it once).\n\nOn the other hand, Q2 checks for the country code not being in the subquery result, which is a more direct and unambiguous reference to a specific country, as each country should have a unique code.\n\nTo create a counterexample, let's assume the following data:\n\ncountry table:\n| Code | Name           | LifeExpectancy |\n|------|----------------|----------------|\n| A    | CountryA       | 70             |\n| B    | CountryA       | 80             |  -- Duplicate name, different code\n| C    | CountryB       | 75             |\n\ncountrylanguage table:\n| CountryCode | Language | IsOfficial |\n|-------------|----------|------------|\n| A           | English  | T          |\n| B           | English  | T          |\n| C           | French   | F          |\n\nFor Q1, the subquery would return 'CountryA' twice (once for each code A and B), but since it's a NOT IN operation, it doesn't matter how many times 'CountryA' appears; it will exclude both CountryA records. The average LifeExpectancy would be calculated only for 'CountryB', which is 75.\n\nFor Q2, the subquery would return codes 'A' and 'B', so both CountryA records would be excluded from the average LifeExpectancy calculation, and again, only 'CountryB' would be considered, which is 75.\n\nHowever, if the country table adheres to the primary key constraint (meaning no duplicate names are allowed), then the two queries would be equivalent because each country name would correspond to exactly one country code, and vice versa.

This means that the country does not have any recorded languages in the database.\n\nFor Q1, this country's code would be included in the result set because it is not a 'Republic' and it is not excluded by the `EXCEPT` clause (since there is no entry to exclude it).\n\nFor Q2, the subquery in the `NOT IN` clause would not return any `CountryCode` for this country because there is no entry in the `countrylanguage` table. However, the `NOT IN` clause would exclude this country if the subquery returns any null values, which is possible if there is a country with a null `CountryCode` in the `countrylanguage` table. SQL treats `NOT IN` with a subquery that returns a null as unknown, and thus the row would not be included in the result set.\n\nHere is an example database modification that would cause the outputs of Q1 and Q2 to differ:\n\n```sql\n-- Insert a country that is not a republic and has no languages listed\nINSERT INTO country (Code, Name, GovernmentForm) VALUES ('XYZ', 'ExampleLand', 'Monarchy');\n\n-- Q1 would include 'XYZ' in the result set.\n-- Q2 would not include 'XYZ' in the result set if there is a NULL CountryCode in the countrylanguage table.\n```\n\nIf there is a row in `countrylanguage` with a `CountryCode` that is `NULL`, Q2 would behave differently because `NOT IN` would not match any rows if there is a `NULL` in the list of values it is checking against.

In SQL, when you use GROUP BY, you must include all the non-aggregated columns in the SELECT list in the GROUP BY clause. The first query (Q1) is actually invalid in standard SQL because it selects 'LANGUAGE' without including it in the GROUP BY clause. Different SQL databases handle this situation differently; some might reject the query, while others might return unpredictable results.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, let's consider the following example database:\n\n```\ncountrylanguage\n----------------\nCountryCode | Language | Percentage\n------------|----------|-----------\nUS          | English  | 80\nUS          | Spanish  | 15\nMX          | Spanish  | 70\nMX          | English  | 20\n```\n\nFor Q1, the query might return something like this (depending on the SQL database behavior):\n\n```\nLANGUAGE | CountryCode | max(Percentage)\n---------|-------------|----------------\nEnglish  | US          | 80\nSpanish  | MX          | 70\n```\n\nFor Q2, the query is invalid because 'Language' is not included in the GROUP BY clause, and it should return an error in a standard-compliant SQL database.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the database allows the omission of 'Language' from the GROUP BY clause and uses some sort of \"hidden\" grouping, the results could be unpredictable and might look like this:\n\n```\nCountryCode | Language | MAX(Percentage)\n------------|----------|----------------\nUS          | English  | 80\nMX          | Spanish  | 70\n```\n\nAs you can see, the results are not identical because the 'Language' associated with the maximum 'Percentage' for each 'CountryCode' might not be the same in both queries. This is because the 'Language' column is not included in the GROUP BY clause, and thus, the database might choose any 'Language' value from the group to display in the results.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT LANGUAGE ,  CountryCode ,  max(Percentage) FROM countrylanguage GROUP BY CountryCode```\n\nQ2:```SELECT CountryCode, Language, MAX(Percentage) FROM countrylanguage GROUP BY CountryCode;```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

It groups the results by `CountryCode`, which means it will return one row per country code with the count of Spanish language entries and the maximum percentage of Spanish speakers for that country.\n\nQ2, on the other hand, performs an inner join between the `country` and `countrylanguage` tables on the `Code` and `CountryCode` columns, respectively. It then filters for rows where the language is Spanish and it is an official language (`IsOfficial = 'T'`). It only counts the number of rows that match these criteria, without grouping by country code or selecting the maximum percentage.\n\nTo illustrate the difference with an example, consider the following data:\n\ncountrylanguage table:\n```\nCountryCode | Language | IsOfficial | Percentage\n------------|----------|------------|-----------\nESP         | Spanish  | T          | 90\nUSA         | Spanish  | F          | 10\nMEX         | Spanish  | T          | 98\nARG         | Spanish  | T          | 97\n```\n\ncountry table:\n```\nCode | Name\n-----|------\nESP  | Spain\nUSA  | United States\nMEX  | Mexico\nARG  | Argentina\n```\n\nFor Q1, the output would be:\n```\ncount(*) | max(Percentage)\n---------|----------------\n1        | 90\n1        | 10\n1        | 98\n1        | 97\n```\n\nFor Q2, the output would be:\n```\ncount(*)\n--------\n3\n```\n\nAs you can see, the outputs are different. Q1 provides a count and maximum percentage per country, while Q2 provides a total count of Spanish-speaking countries where Spanish is an official language.\n\nTo further demonstrate that they are not equivalent, consider modifying the `countrylanguage` table to include a non-official Spanish language entry for a country:\n\n```\nCountryCode | Language | IsOfficial | Percentage\n------------|----------|------------|-----------\nESP         | Spanish  | T          | 90\nUSA         | Spanish  | F          | 10\nMEX         | Spanish  | T          | 98\nARG         | Spanish  | T          | 97\nUSA         | Spanish  | T          | 20\n```\n\nNow, Q1 would still return the same result as before because it does not consider whether Spanish is an official language. However, Q2 would now return a count of 4 because there is an additional row where Spanish is an official language in the USA.\n\nTherefore, since we can find a counterexample where the outputs of Q1 and Q2 are not identical, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT count(*) ,   max(Percentage) FROM countrylanguage WHERE LANGUAGE  =  \"Spanish\" GROUP BY CountryCode```\n\nQ2:```SELECT count(*) FROM country AS T1 JOIN countrylanguage AS T2 ON T1.Code = T2.CountryCode WHERE T2.Language = 'Spanish' AND T2.IsOfficial = 'T'```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

However, the GROUP BY clause is based on T1.name, which means it groups by the highschooler's name rather than their ID. If there are two highschoolers with the same name but different IDs, the result could be different.\n\nTo create a counterexample, let's add another highschooler with the same name as Alice but a different ID:\n\nHighschooler Table (modified):\n| ID | name   | grade |\n|----|--------|-------|\n| 1  | Alice  | 10    |\n| 2  | Bob    | 11    |\n| 3  | Carol  | 12    |\n| 4  | Alice  | 10    |\n\nFriend Table (modified):\n| student_id | friend_id |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 1          | 2         |\n| 1          | 3         |\n| 4          | 2         |\n\nNow, when we run Q1, it will still return \"Alice\" because the query is grouping by student_id and Alice with ID 1 has the most friends.\n\nHowever, when we run Q2, it will group by name and since there are two Alices, it will count the total number of friends for both Alices combined. Since both Alices have one friend each, the total count will be 2, which is the same as the count for Alice with ID 1 alone. Depending on the SQL implementation and how it handles ties in the ORDER BY clause, it might return either Alice with ID 1 or Alice with ID 4, or it might return both if the LIMIT 1 is not strictly enforced.\n\nThis demonstrates that the two queries are not equivalent because they can produce different results based on the database content.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.name FROM Friend AS T1 JOIN Highschooler AS T2 ON T1.student_id  =  T2.id GROUP BY T1.student_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT T1.name FROM Highschooler AS T1 JOIN Friend AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.student_id GROUP BY T1.name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

This means it will select professionals with IDs 1, 2, and 3.\n\nQ2 will select all professionals from Indiana or those who have performed more than 2 treatments. However, the subquery in Q2 will only select professional ID 3 because it's the only one with more than 2 treatments. Then the main query will select professionals from Indiana (IDs 1 and 2) and also include professional ID 3 because it's in the subquery result. So Q2 will also select professionals with IDs 1, 2, and 3.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like the results are the same, but there is a subtle difference. The UNION operator in Q1 removes duplicates, while the OR condition in Q2 does not. If there is a professional from Indiana who also has performed more than 2 treatments, Q1 will list them only once, while Q2 will list them twice if we don't use DISTINCT or GROUP BY to remove duplicates.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's modify the Treatments table to include a professional from Indiana who has performed more than 2 treatments:\n\nTreatments Table (modified):\n| treatment_id | dog_id | professional_id | treatment_type_code | date_of_treatment | cost_of_treatment |\n|--------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 1            | ...    | 1               | ...                 | ...               | ...               |\n| 2            | ...    | 1               | ...                 | ...               | ...               |\n| 3            | ...    | 1               | ...                 | ...               | ...               |\n| 4            | ...    | 3               | ...                 | ...               | ...               |\n| 5            | ...    | 3               | ...                 | ...               | ...               |\n| 6            | ...    | 3               | ...                 | ...               | ...               |\n\nNow, Q1 will still list professional ID 1 only once, but Q2 will list professional ID 1 twice because it satisfies both conditions (from Indiana and has more than 2 treatments).

In this case:\n\nQ1 will still return only one row due to the LIMIT 1 clause, but which row it returns can be non-deterministic because of the tie (it depends on the database's internal tie-breaking mechanism, which could be based on the order of insertion or other factors).\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will return both owners because the subquery will find both owner_ids as having the highest count of dogs, and the main query does not have a LIMIT clause to restrict the number of results.\n\nTherefore, the two queries are not equivalent because there exists a database (the modified one) for which the two queries yield different results.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T1.owner_id ,  T2.first_name ,  T2.last_name FROM Dogs AS T1 JOIN Owners AS T2 ON T1.owner_id  =  T2.owner_id GROUP BY T1.owner_id ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1```\n\nQ2:```SELECT owner_id, first_name, last_name FROM Owners WHERE owner_id IN (SELECT owner_id FROM Dogs GROUP BY owner_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1)```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Since John Doe has two dogs, he will be the top result. The query will then limit the result to only the top owner, which is John Doe.\n\nQ1 Output:\n| owner_id | first_name | last_name |\n|----------|------------|-----------|\n| 1        | John       | Doe       |\n\nQ2 will first find the owner_id with the most dogs by grouping and ordering in the subquery, which will be owner 1 (John Doe).

However, if we modify the example database to include another owner with the same number of dogs as the top owner, the outputs will differ.\n\nLet's add another owner with two dogs:\n\nOwners Table:\n| owner_id | first_name | last_name |\n|----------|------------|-----------|\n| 1        | John       | Doe       |\n| 2        | Jane       | Smith     |\n| 3        | Alice      | Johnson   |\n\nDogs Table:\n| dog_id | owner_id | ... |\n|--------|----------|-----|\n| 1      | 1        | ... |\n| 2      | 1        | ... |\n| 3      | 2        | ... |\n| 4      | 3        | ... |\n| 5      | 3        | ... |\n\nNow, both John Doe and Alice Johnson have two dogs each. Q1 will still return only one row, but which row it returns can depend on the database's internal ordering if there is a tie in the count. It could return either John Doe or Alice Johnson.\n\nQ1 Output (could vary):\n| owner_id | first_name | last_name |\n|----------|------------|-----------|\n| 1        | John       | Doe       |\nOR\n| owner_id | first_name | last_name |\n|----------|------------|-----------|\n| 3        | Alice      | Johnson   |\n\nQ2, on the other hand, will return an error or an empty result because the subquery is expected to return a single value, but it will find two owner_ids with the same highest count of dogs.

Since there are two charge_types (TypeB and TypeC) with the same maximum charge_amount (200), the database could return either one as the result of Q2.\n\nTherefore, Q1 and Q2 are not equivalent because Q1 returns the maximum charge amount, while Q2 returns a charge_type associated with the maximum charge amount, and in cases of ties, Q2 could return different charge_types.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT max(charge_amount) FROM Charges```\n\nQ2:```SELECT charge_type FROM Charges ORDER BY charge_amount DESC LIMIT 1```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.

Counter example to show non-equivalence:\n\nLet's modify the example database to include another charge with the same maximum amount but a different charge type:\n\n| charge_id | charge_type | charge_amount |\n|-----------|-------------|---------------|\n| 1         | TypeA       | 100           |\n| 2         | TypeB       | 300           |\n| 3         | TypeC       | 300           |\n\nFor Q1, the output will still be:\n\n| max(charge_amount) |\n|--------------------|\n| 300                |\n\nFor Q2, the output will be one of the following rows, depending on which one the database system chooses to return first when ordering by charge_amount in descending order:\n\n| charge_type | charge_amount |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| TypeB       | 300           |\n| TypeC       | 300           |\n\nSince Q2 can return different results based on the presence of multiple rows with the same maximum charge_amount, but different charge_types, the two queries are not equivalent.

This query does not have a GROUP BY clause, which means that if there are multiple properties with the same property_type_code, each one will result in a separate row in the output.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider the following example database:\n\nRef_Property_Types:\n| property_type_code | property_type_description |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| 1                  | Apartment                 |\n| 2                  | House                     |\n\nProperties:\n| property_id | property_type_code |\n|-------------|---------------------|\n| 1           | 1                   |\n| 2           | 1                   |\n| 3           | 2                   |\n\nFor this example, Q1 would return:\n| property_type_description |\n|---------------------------|\n| Apartment                 |\n| House                     |\n\nQ2 would return:\n| property_type_description |\n|---------------------------|\n| Apartment                 |\n| Apartment                 |\n| House                     |\n\nAs you can see, Q2 returns the 'Apartment' description twice because there are two properties with the property_type_code '1', while Q1 returns each description only once due to the GROUP BY clause. Therefore, the two queries are not equivalent.", "prompt": "Here are two SQL queries, Q1 and Q2 following DATABASE SCHEMA.\nYour task is to think and determine if the following two SQL queries (Q1 and Q2) are equivalent or not equivalent.\n\nQ1:```SELECT T2.property_type_description FROM Properties AS T1 JOIN Ref_Property_Types AS T2 ON T1.property_type_code  =  T2.property_type_code GROUP BY T1.property_type_code```\n\nQ2:```SELECT property_type_description FROM Ref_Property_Types RPT, Properties P WHERE RPT.property_type_code = P.property_type_code```\n\n\nNote: Two SQL queries are semantically equivalent if and only if they yield identical results for all possible databases.\n\n1.
